at	X
the	X
overall	X
figures	X

India	X

reluctance	X
to	X
publish	X
the	X
survey	X
is	X
rather	X
surprising	X

shows	X

country	X
has	X
an	X
encouraging	X
story	X
to	X
tell	X

Indicators	X

are	X
still	X
very	X
high	X

far	X
higher	X
than	X
most	X

they	X
are	X

,	X
two-fifths	X

is	X
more	X
like	X
a	X
third	X

However	X
,	X
the	X
survey	X
confirms	X
large	X
and	X
enduring	X
discrepancies	X
between	X
states	X
,	X
including	X
the	X
continuing	X
strikingly	X
poor	X
performance	X
of	X
the	X
Indian	X
prime	X

Narendra	X

ran	X
the	X
state	X
for	X
more	X
than	X
a	X
decade	X

His	X
general	X

on	X
the	X

The	X
results	X
of	X
the	X
survey	X
might	X
lead	X
some	X
people	X
to	X
question	X
whether	X
-	X
in	X
terms	X

-	X
it	X
is	X
really	X
a	X
model	X
the	X
nation	X
should	X
seek	X
to	X
emulate	X

It	X
shows	X
that	X
despite	X
impressive	X
economic	X
growth	X
,	X
the	X
state	X
continues	X
to	X
have	X
some	X
of	X
the	X
worst	X
health	X
outcomes	X
in	X
India	X
.	X

It	X
says	X
41.8	X
%	X
of	X
children	X
in	X
Gujarat	X
are	X
stunted	X
while	X
43.8	X
%	X

Gujarat	X
's	X
poor	X

have	X
led	X
to	X
speculation	X
that	X
one	X
reason	X
the	X
government	X
has	X
been	X
holding	X
back	X
the	X
report	X
is	X
to	X
spare	X

that	X
Gujarat	X

festival	X
has	X
also	X
had	X
criticism	X
.	X

Some	X
say	X
that	X
,	X
while	X
the	X
line-up	X
may	X
excite	X
the	X
artistic	X
elite	X
,	X
most	X
of	X
it	X
is	X
too	X
highbrow	X

Bjork	X
began	X
her	X
Biophilia	X
tour	X

returning	X

year	X

"	X
I	X
defy	X
anyone	X
with	X
a	X
curious	X
mind	X
not	X
to	X
go	X
to	X
the	X
Whitworth	X
art	X
gallery	X
and	X
look	X
at	X
Gerhard	X
Richter	X
's	X
paintings	X

not	X
find	X
something	X
of	X
value	X
and	X
interest	X
in	X
those	X
,"	X
Poots	X
says	X
.	X

"	X
And	X
they	X
are	X
supposedly	X
high	X
art	X
.	X

So	X
for	X
all	X
the	X
people	X
that	X
who	X
think	X
high	X
art	X
is	X
not	X
for	X
them	X
-	X
it	X
's	X
just	X
like	X
saying	X
good	X
food	X
is	X
not	X
for	X
them	X
.	X

It	X
does	X
n't	X
make	X
any	X
sense	X
to	X
me	X
.	X

"	X
There	X
are	X
certain	X
artistic	X
languages	X
that	X
are	X
more	X
difficult	X
than	X
others	X
-	X
certain	X
aspects	X
of	X
modernist	X
classical	X
music	X
require	X
more	X
research	X
and	X
a	X
bit	X
more	X
time	X
to	X
get	X
into	X
it	X
.	X

But	X
that	X
's	X
a	X
joy	X
.	X

Spend	X
the	X
time	X
with	X
it	X
.	X

"	X
And	X
if	X
you	X
do	X
n't	X
want	X
to	X
spend	X
the	X
time	X
with	X
it	X
,	X
then	X
fine	X
.	X

But	X
do	X
n't	X
annex	X
it	X
off	X
as	X
some	X
weird	X
museum	X
piece	X
that	X
should	X
just	X
be	X
viewed	X
with	X
scepticism	X
.	X

"	X
Culture	X
is	X
a	X
wonderful	X
enriching	X
thing	X
and	X
people	X
should	X
savour	X
it	X

There	X
's	X
no	X
such	X
thing	X

much	X

As	X
long	X
as	X
it	X
's	X
good	X

Another	X
criticism	X
is	X
that	X
the	X
festival	X
works	X
with	X
the	X
same	X
artists	X
-	X
such	X
as	X
Albarn	X

Poots	X
says	X
:	X
"	X
Once	X
you	X

a	X

understood	X

they	X
're	X
doing	X

you	X
've	X
got	X
to	X

with	X
what	X
they	X
want	X
to	X
achieve	X
,	X
the	X
idea	X
that	X
you	X
would	X
just	X
let	X

Albarn	X
's	X
Alice	X
in	X

an	X
example	X
,	X
Poots	X
says	X
,	X
of	X
where	X
a	X
relationship	X
has	X
paid	X
off	X

He	X
had	X
been	X
trying	X
to	X
persuade	X
Albarn	X
to	X
write	X
a	X
musical	X

but	X
had	X
always	X
been	X
rebuffed	X
-	X
until	X
he	X
decided	X
that	X
Alice	X
in	X

might	X
tempt	X
the	X
musician	X

"	X

thought	X
)	X
that	X

him	X

Poots	X

That	X
is	X
another	X
of	X
the	X
secrets	X

the	X
festival	X

success	X

This	X
year	X

collaboration	X
between	X
Richter	X

grew	X
out	X
of	X
a	X
hunch	X
that	X

would	X
hit	X
it	X
off	X

So	X
Poots	X
and	X
curator	X
Hans-Ulrich	X
Obrist	X
spent	X
nine	X
months	X

for	X
them	X

a	X
result	X

Part	X
has	X
composed	X
a	X

with	X
his	X
father	X
,	X
he	X
will	X
effectively	X
be	X
James	X
's	X
boss	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
when	X
Rupert	X
Murdoch	X
does	X
finally	X
relinquish	X
control	X
,	X
it	X
will	X
mark	X
a	X
deep	X
cultural	X
shift	X
in	X
the	X
business	X
he	X
created	X
.	X

There	X
is	X
an	X
excellent	X
story	X
in	X
William	X
Shawcross	X
's	X
biography	X
of	X
Mr	X
Murdoch	X
in	X
which	X
he	X
describes	X
a	X
dispute	X
with	X
his	X
printers	X
over	X
turning	X
the	X
Sun	X
into	X
a	X
tabloid	X
.	X

The	X
printers	X
said	X
it	X
could	X
not	X
be	X
done	X
.	X

Mr	X
Murdoch	X
took	X
off	X
his	X
jacket	X
,	X
climbed	X
on	X
to	X
the	X
printing	X
press	X
and	X
picked	X
up	X
an	X
oily	X
bar	X
that	X
was	X
lying	X
in	X
a	X
rag	X
.	X

This	X
was	X
the	X
solution	X
-	X
the	X
presses	X
had	X
originally	X
been	X
supplied	X
with	X
bars	X
that	X
could	X
fold	X
the	X
pages	X
to	X
tabloid	X
size	X
-	X
and	X
the	X
printers'	X
bluff	X
had	X
been	X
called	X
.	X

Printers	X
ink	X
was	X
in	X
his	X
blood	X
,	X
he	X
understood	X
everything	X
about	X
the	X
business	X
of	X
newspapers	X
.	X

The	X
person	X
who	X
follows	X
him	X
will	X
almost	X
certainly	X
not	X
share	X
that	X
enthusiasm	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
while	X
ink	X
on	X
paper	X
may	X
be	X
a	X
business	X
in	X
decline	X
,	X
selling	X
news	X
and	X
entertainment	X
is	X
not	X
-	X
it	X
's	X
just	X
being	X
sold	X
and	X
delivered	X
in	X
a	X
different	X
way	X
.	X

Investors	X
will	X
want	X
to	X
know	X
if	X
the	X
younger	X
Murdochs	X
have	X
a	X
convincing	X
argument	X
about	X
how	X
to	X
turn	X
the	X
content	X
they	X
own	X
into	X
cash	X
in	X
such	X
a	X
fast-changing	X
business	X
.	X

So	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
are	X
wanting	X
a	X
clear	X
answer	X
as	X
to	X
who	X
is	X
going	X
to	X
take	X
over	X
after	X
Rupert	X
,	X
we	X
do	X
not	X
have	X
it	X
yet	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
three	X
Murdochs	X
-	X
all	X
with	X
something	X
to	X
prove	X
-	X
keep	X
watching	X

turn	X
when	X

a	X

Guirgis	X
told	X
the	X

about	X

Guirgis	X
won	X
this	X

for	X

The	X
reviews	X
have	X
been	X
very	X
good	X
,	X
so	X
how	X
does	X
it	X
feel	X
to	X
have	X
a	X
play	X
at	X
the	X
National	X
?	X

This	X
is	X
an	X
important	X
season	X
at	X
one	X
of	X
your	X
most	X
important	X
theatres	X
,	X
so	X
the	X
fact	X
they	X
chose	X
to	X
do	X
a	X
play	X
of	X
mine	X
is	X
a	X
real	X
honour	X
and	X
the	X
fact	X
that	X
it	X
is	X
apparently	X
being	X
well	X
received	X
makes	X
me	X
feel	X
a	X
sense	X
of	X
relief	X
that	X
it	X
did	X
n't	X
let	X
anybody	X
down	X
.	X

Does	X
it	X
bother	X
you	X
that	X
the	X
theatre	X
has	X
put	X
asterisks	X
in	X
the	X
title	X
?	X

I	X
get	X
it	X
.	X

When	X
I	X
wrote	X
the	X
play	X
originally	X
I	X
did	X
n't	X
think	X
it	X
was	X
going	X
to	X
Broadway	X
or	X
the	X
National	X
.	X

It	X
felt	X
like	X
the	X
right	X
title	X
for	X
this	X
play	X
.	X

The	X
title	X
is	X
a	X
blessing	X
and	X
a	X
curse	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
a	X
curse	X
because	X
sometimes	X
that	X
's	X
where	X
the	X
conversation	X
begins	X
and	X
ends	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
a	X
blessing	X
because	X
it	X
's	X
like	X
a	X
disclaimer	X
.	X

You	X
ca	X
n't	X
walk	X
into	X
a	X
play	X
with	X
this	X
title	X
and	X
be	X
offended	X
.	X

What	X
I	X
'd	X
hoped	X
for	X
in	X
London	X
and	X
New	X
York	X
is	X
that	X
when	X
you	X
come	X
and	X
see	X
the	X
play	X
you	X
'll	X
have	X
an	X
experience	X
that	X
transcends	X
your	X
experience	X
of	X
the	X
title	X
.	X

Have	X
producers	X
ever	X
suggested	X
that	X
the	X
title	X
might	X
hurt	X
the	X
play	X
's	X
commercial	X
prospects	X
?	X

Initially	X
producers	X
did	X
n't	X
have	X
any	X
problem	X
with	X
it	X
,	X
but	X
then	X
they	X
discovered	X
it	X
's	X
difficult	X
to	X
figure	X
out	X
what	X
to	X
call	X
it	X
for	X
the	X
internet	X
.	X

No-one	X
ever	X
told	X
me	X
to	X
change	X
it	X
,	X
so	X
I	X
did	X
n't	X
.	X

What	X
sparked	X
the	X
idea	X
for	X
this	X
play	X
?	X

Some	X
of	X
the	X
play	X
I	X
've	X
experienced	X
,	X
for	X
sure	X
,	X
other	X
parts	X
I	X
have	X
n't	X
.	X

I	X
'm	X
interested	X
in	X
codes	X
of	X
conduct	X
.	X

When	X
we	X
're	X
younger	X
,	X
our	X
friendships	X
are	X
probably	X
the	X
things	X
that	X
are	X
most	X
prized	X
,	X
We	X
have	X
an	X
organised	X
set	X
of	X
rules	X
built	X
around	X
them	X
that	X
we	X
mostly	X
follow	X
.	X

But	X
then	X
when	X
we	X
get	X
older	X
,	X
life	X
gets	X
more	X
complicated	X
and	X
those	X
loyalties	X
and	X
codes	X
can	X
be	X
broken	X
.	X

I	X
'm	X
interested	X
in	X
what	X
is	X
acceptable	X
behaviour	X
amongst	X
friends	X
.	X

Most	X
of	X
my	X
plays	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
break	X
them	X
down	X
,	X
are	X
about	X
people	X
who	X
are	X
past	X
the	X
age	X
where	X
they	X
should	X
have	X
already	X
grown	X
up	X
still	X
trying	X
to	X
grow	X
up	X
.	X

How	X
does	X
it	X
feel	X
to	X
have	X
the	X
Pulitzer	X
Prize	X
for	X
Drama	X
on	X
your	X
CV	X
?	X

It	X
's	X
a	X
little	X
surreal	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
not	X
tattooed	X
on	X
my	X
arm	X
but	X
you	X
're	X
right	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
on	X
my	X
resume	X
,	X
and	X
I	X
figure	X
in	X
the	X
worst-case	X
scenario	X
if	X
I	X
bomb	X
out	X
as	X
a	X
playwright	X
I	X
'll	X
be	X
able	X
to	X
get	X
a	X
job	X
teaching	X
.	X

If	X
I	X
'm	X
in	X
a	X
plane	X
crash	X
maybe	X
they	X
'll	X
put	X
"	X
Pulitzer	X
Prize	X
winner	X
Guirgis	X
dies	X
"	X
.	X

I	X
'm	X
glad	X
it	X
happened	X
.	X

I	X
have	X
the	X
plaque	X
,	X
I	X
went	X
to	X
the	X
ceremony	X
and	X
I	X
'm	X
grateful	X
-	X
but	X
I	X
've	X
got	X
to	X
get	X
on	X
with	X
what	X
's	X
next	X
.	X

And	X
that	X
's	X
a	X
Netflix	X
series	X
called	X
The	X
Get	X
Down	X
with	X
Baz	X
Luhrmann	X
about	X
the	X
birth	X
of	X
hip	X
hop	X
?	X

It	X
's	X
a	X
coming-of-age	X
story	X
of	X
these	X
five	X
kids	X
in	X
the	X
south	X
Bronx	X
in	X
the	X
70s	X
and	X
the	X
cultural	X
and	X
artistic	X
revolutions	X
that	X
came	X
out	X
of	X
New	X
York	X
:	X
hip	X
hop	X
,	X
punk	X
rock	X
and	X
the	X
graffiti	X
and	X
breakdance	X
scenes	X

I	X
grew	X
up	X
in	X
New	X
York	X
,	X
so	X
I	X
know	X
a	X
bit	X
about	X
it	X
,	X
but	X
doing	X
the	X
research	X
has	X
been	X
great	X
.	X

The	X
play	X
received	X
six	X
Tony	X
nominations	X
on	X
Broadway	X

Has	X
it	X
been	X
a	X
very	X
different	X
experience	X
from	X
writing	X
a	X
play	X
?	X

I	X
've	X
done	X
some	X
television	X
work	X
before	X
.	X

There	X
's	X
less	X
autonomy	X
.	X

Working	X
with	X
Baz	X
I	X
learn	X
so	X
much	X
about	X
the	X
execution	X
of	X
story	X
.	X

We	X
'll	X
be	X
talking	X
about	X
a	X
character	X
like	X
a	X
breakdancer	X
or	X
a	X
drug	X
dealer	X
and	X
he	X
'll	X
reference	X
the	X
Greeks	X
and	X
Shakespeare	X
and	X
connect	X
the	X
story	X
to	X
a	X
continuum	X
that	X
's	X
been	X
going	X
on	X
for	X
thousands	X

years	X

As	X
a	X
Pulitzer	X

what	X
will	X
your	X
next	X

be	X
about	X
?	X

It	X
's	X
a	X
boxing	X

a	X
period	X

two	X

study	X

First	X
,	X
they	X
measured	X
natural	X
levels	X
of	X
the	X
two	X
hormones	X
in	X
142	X
male	X

female	X
volunteers	X
while	X
they	X
played	X
a	X
trading	X
game	X
in	X
groups	X
of	X
10	X
.	X

Men	X
who	X
had	X
higher	X
levels	X
of	X
cortisol	X
were	X
more	X
likely	X
to	X
take	X
risks	X
,	X
which	X
led	X
to	X
instability	X
in	X
prices	X
.	X

But	X
there	X
did	X
not	X
appear	X
to	X
be	X
a	X
link	X
between	X
cortisol	X
and	X
risky	X

with	X
other	X

showing	X
that	X

in	X
different	X
ways	X
.	X

In	X
a	X
second	X
experiment	X
,	X
75	X
young	X
men	X
were	X
given	X
one	X
of	X
the	X
hormones	X
before	X
playing	X
the	X
game	X
,	X
and	X
then	X
a	X
placebo	X
.	X

The	X
results	X
showed	X
that	X
cortisol	X
appeared	X
to	X
encourage	X
riskier	X

while	X
testosterone	X
increased	X

To	X
do	X
this	X

they	X
designed	X

asked	X

look	X

such	X
as	X
the	X
Leaning	X

mapping	X
separate	X
nerve	X

The	X
study	X
used	X
images	X

We	X

are	X
actually	X

for	X
streamlining	X
and	X
refocusing	X
the	X
complaints	X
system	X
around	X
what	X
people	X
want	X
.	X

Firstly	X
,	X
the	X
system	X
needs	X
to	X
make	X
it	X
easier	X
for	X
people	X
to	X
complain	X
,	X
including	X
institutions	X
understanding	X
that	X
everyone	X
,	X
including	X
third	X
parties	X
,	X
has	X
the	X
right	X
to	X
raise	X
concerns	X
.	X

Secondly	X
,	X
every	X
case	X
should	X
be	X
dealt	X
with	X
compassionately	X
,	X
with	X
a	X
speedy	X
,	X
personalised	X
response	X
that	X
actually	X
addresses	X
the	X
poor	X
experience	X
and	X
includes	X
an	X
outline	X
of	X
what	X
happens	X
next	X
.	X

Lastly	X
,	X
those	X
who	X
fail	X
to	X
up	X
their	X
game	X
must	X
be	X
held	X
to	X
account	X
by	X
being	X
put	X
into	X
"	X
special	X
measures	X
"	X
by	X
the	X
regulators	X
,	X
issued	X
with	X
financial	X
penalties	X
and	X
ultimately	X
being	X
shut	X
down	X
and	X
replaced	X
.	X

In	X
short	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
time	X
for	X
the	X
health	X
and	X
social	X
care	X
sector	X
to	X
get	X
serious	X
about	X
complaints	X
,	X
and	X
stop	X
finding	X
loopholes	X
to	X

up	X

part	X

the	X
sense	X
of	X
taste	X
,	X
smell	X

appetite	X
can	X
be	X
dramatically	X
altered	X

all	X
food	X
tastes	X
of	X
metal	X

their	X
daily	X
cup	X

a	X
complete	X

For	X
others	X
it	X
can	X
be	X
even	X
worse	X
;	X
they	X
find	X
their	X
mouths	X
dry	X
up	X

ulcers	X

making	X
eating	X
very	X
painful	X

Taste	X
changes	X

is	X
the	X

most	X
affected	X
by	X

its	X
treatment	X
,	X
meaning	X
familiar	X
food	X
and	X

often	X
becomes	X
unpalatable	X

Taste	X
changes	X
may	X

a	X
number	X
of	X

factors	X

damage	X

Cravings	X

Emma	X
was	X
diagnosed	X
with	X
breast	X
cancer	X
just	X
after	X
her	X
40th	X
birthday	X
.	X

She	X
then	X
underwent	X
six	X
rounds	X
of	X
chemotherapy	X
,	X
a	X
lumpectomy	X
and	X
radiotherapy	X
.	X

The	X
cycles	X
of	X
chemotherapy	X
-	X
and	X
other	X
medication	X
she	X
had	X
to	X
take	X
-	X
had	X
dramatic	X
effects	X
on	X
her	X
appetite	X
.	X

Emma	X
says	X
:	X
"	X
I	X
was	X
prescribed	X
steroids	X
to	X
take	X
on	X
the	X
day	X
before	X
,	X
the	X
day	X
of	X
and	X
the	X
day	X
after	X
having	X
chemo	X
.	X

I	X
woke	X
up	X
at	X
2am	X
after	X
the	X
first	X
dose	X
and	X
ate	X
several	X
huge	X
slices	X
of	X
cake	X
.	X

This	X
continued	X
for	X
about	X
20	X
hours	X
a	X
day	X
for	X
three	X
days	X
during	X
each	X
cycle	X
.	X

My	X
appetite	X
was	X
insatiable	X
.	X
"	X

But	X
the	X
chemo	X
also	X
affected	X
her	X
sense	X
of	X
taste	X
which	X
"	X
totally	X
disappeared	X
"	X
on	X
the	X
second	X
day	X
after	X
the	X
first	X
dose	X
.	X

Apart	X
from	X
the	X
three	X
days	X
of	X
steroid	X
treatment	X
,	X
Emma	X
saw	X
her	X
appetite	X
plummet	X
during	X
the	X
rest	X

the	X
treatment	X
cycle	X

Cancer	X
treatment	X
has	X
a	X
multitude	X
of	X
effects	X
on	X
the	X
body	X

"	X
I	X
only	X
craved	X
salty	X
foods	X
-	X
even	X
though	X
I	X
could	X
n't	X
taste	X

I	X
ate	X
lots	X
of	X
salty	X
mashed	X
potato	X
and	X
gravy	X

Ditch	X
the	X
soup	X

Those	X
patients	X
who	X
lose	X
their	X
appetite	X
are	X
likely	X
to	X
lose	X
weight	X
-	X
but	X
the	X
same	X
can	X
be	X
true	X
even	X
if	X
a	X
high	X
calorie	X
diet	X
is	X
being	X
eaten	X
,	X
due	X
to	X
changes	X
in	X
the	X
body	X
.	X

That	X
's	X
because	X
cancers	X
can	X
produce	X
molecules	X
that	X
change	X
the	X
way	X
the	X
body	X
functions	X
.	X

For	X
example	X
,	X
cytokines	X
are	X
proteins	X
normally	X
produced	X
by	X
the	X
immune	X
system	X
to	X
help	X
your	X
body	X
fight	X
infections	X
.	X

Cancers	X
are	X
known	X
to	X
produce	X
these	X
in	X
large	X
numbers	X
.	X

This	X
abnormal	X
release	X
leads	X
can	X
cause	X
weight	X
loss	X
by	X
making	X
the	X
body	X
break	X
down	X
proteins	X
and	X
fat	X
.	X

High	X
energy	X
foods	X
can	X
help	X
people	X
to	X
maintain	X
their	X
weight	X
,	X
but	X
Dr	X
Shaw	X
notes	X
that	X
it	X
is	X
sometimes	X
hard	X
to	X
know	X
what	X
to	X
eat	X
.	X

Many	X
of	X
her	X
patients	X
eat	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
soup	X
.	X

"	X
It	X
's	X
liquid	X
,	X
it	X
goes	X
down	X
easily	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
a	X
prime	X
choice	X
.	X

But	X
,	X
as	X
a	X
dietician	X
,	X
I	X
will	X
often	X
talk	X
to	X
them	X
about	X
the	X
fact	X
that	X
soup	X
is	X
often	X
low	X
in	X
energy	X
,	X
and	X
it	X
's	X
often	X
low	X
in	X
protein	X
.	X

"	X
So	X
people	X
might	X
be	X
using	X
it	X
as	X
a	X
replacement	X
for	X
a	X
meal	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
's	X
not	X
providing	X
the	X
same	X
nourishment	X
as	X
a	X
meal	X
.	X
'	X

Other	X
high	X
energy	X
meals	X
such	X
as	X
roasted	X
chicken	X
,	X
or	X
more	X
nutritious	X
soups	X
,	X
are	X
advised	X
.	X

Soft	X
is	X
best	X

Ginger	X
is	X
often	X
recommended	X
for	X
patients	X
-	X
but	X
does	X
n't	X
suit	X
all	X

People	X
being	X
treated	X
for	X
cancer	X
often	X
find	X
it	X
difficult	X
to	X
eat	X
due	X
to	X
a	X
sore	X
or	X
dry	X
mouth	X
or	X
throat	X
and	X
difficulty	X
swallowing	X
whilst	X
undergoing	X
treatment	X

That	X
's	X
because	X
the	X
digestive	X
system	X
is	X
lined	X
with	X
a	X
soft	X
layer	X
of	X
tissue	X
called	X
the	X
mucous	X
membrane	X
.	X

This	X
tissue	X
is	X
susceptible	X
to	X
damage	X
during	X
some	X
cancer	X
treatments	X
such	X
as	X
chemotherapy	X
,	X

The	X
resulting	X
inflammation	X
and	X
ulceration	X
is	X
called	X
mucositis	X
.	X

Oral	X
mucositis	X
leads	X
to	X
the	X
pain	X
and	X
difficulty	X
of	X
swallowing	X
.	X

Emma	X
says	X
that	X
was	X
a	X
real	X
problem	X
.	X

"	X
My	X
nurse	X
told	X
me	X
the	X
sore	X
mouth	X
was	X
a	X
possible	X
side	X
effect	X
so	X
I	X
was	X
sort	X
of	X
expecting	X
it	X
but	X
it	X
was	X
far	X
worse	X
than	X
I	X
imagined	X
.	X

"	X
My	X
oncologist	X
suggested	X
fresh	X
pineapple	X
to	X
help	X
soothe	X
and	X
cleanse	X
my	X
mouth	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
the	X
only	X
thing	X
I	X
really	X
ate	X
that	X
felt	X
like	X
it	X
was	X
giving	X
me	X
any	X
goodness	X

'	X
I	X
missed	X
eating	X

Keeping	X
up	X
with	X
the	X
changes	X
and	X
challenges	X
of	X
eating	X
is	X
very	X
emotional	X
for	X
many	X

"	X
I	X
loved	X
food	X

eating	X
and	X
cooking	X
and	X
not	X
to	X
be	X
able	X
to	X
derive	X
any	X
pleasure	X
from	X
food	X

really	X
hard	X

said	X
Emma	X

"	X

enjoying	X
simple	X
things	X

out	X

"	X

The	X
advice	X
from	X
Dr	X
Shaw	X
and	X
other	X
leading	X
cancer	X
charities	X
is	X
to	X
be	X
flexible	X
with	X
meals	X
and	X
to	X
eat	X
what	X
you	X
can	X
when	X
you	X
can	X

people	X
fully	X
recover	X
their	X
sense	X

taste	X

Overheating	X
man	X

Temperatures	X
are	X
rising	X
across	X
Europe	X
and	X
while	X
the	X
sun	X
is	X
out	X
so	X
are	X
the	X
health	X
warnings	X
.	X

Heatwaves	X
can	X
have	X
a	X
profound	X
effect	X
on	X
the	X
body	X
beyond	X
sunburn	X
-	X
it	X
can	X
be	X
deadly	X
.	X

The	X
earliest	X
,	X
and	X
relatively	X
mild	X
,	X
heat-related	X
issues	X
are	X
:	X
*	X
heat	X
cramps	X
caused	X
by	X
dehydration	X
(	X
it	X
's	X
often	X
linked	X
to	X
exercise	X
)	X

heat	X
rash	X
*	X
heat	X
oedema	X
which	X
mainly	X
takes	X
the	X
form	X
of	X
swollen	X
ankles	X

The	X
more	X
serious	X
problems	X
include	X
heat	X
exhaustion	X
,	X
which	X
develops	X
into	X
fatal	X
heatstroke	X

Sick	X
and	X
faint	X

Sweating	X
is	X
the	X
main	X
method	X
your	X
body	X
uses	X
to	X
keep	X
cool	X
as	X
temperatures	X
rise	X
.	X

But	X
all	X
the	X
time	X
you	X
're	X
sweating	X
you	X
're	X
also	X
losing	X
salts	X
and	X
water	X
and	X
it	X
leads	X
to	X
a	X
drop	X
in	X
blood	X
pressure	X
.	X

Symptoms	X
of	X
heat	X
exhaustion	X
are	X
similar	X
to	X
being	X
dehydrated	X
-	X
feeling	X
sick	X
,	X
faint	X
and	X
sometimes	X
shock	X
.	X

Treatment	X
should	X
be	X
relatively	X
easy	X
at	X
this	X
stage	X
-	X
drinking	X
plenty	X
of	X
water	X
and	X
moving	X
to	X
a	X
cooler	X
place	X
.	X

But	X
things	X
can	X
become	X
much	X
worse	X
and	X
develop	X
into	X
heatstroke	X
.	X

Eventually	X
the	X
body	X
's	X
ability	X
to	X
sweat	X
shuts	X
down	X
as	X
fluid	X
levels	X
become	X
dangerously	X
low	X
.	X

Someone	X
who	X
once	X
looked	X
bright	X
pink	X
and	X
sweaty	X
becomes	X
pale	X
with	X
hot	X
dry	X
skin	X
.	X

With	X
no	X
way	X
of	X
cooling	X
down	X
,	X
core	X
body	X
temperature	X
can	X
soar	X
above	X
40C	X
(	X
it	X
is	X
normally	X
37C	X

Symptoms	X
at	X
this	X

For	X
what	X
has	X
it	X
been	X
used	X
?	X

The	X
Â£	X
320m	X
Independent	X
Living	X
Fund	X
currently	X
pays	X
out	X
an	X
average	X
of	X
Â£	X
300	X
a	X
week	X
to	X
approximately	X
18,000	X
disabled	X
people	X
.	X

The	X
largest	X
group	X
of	X
recipients	X
-	X
about	X
a	X
third	X
-	X
have	X
severe	X
learning	X
disabilities	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
second	X
largest	X
group	X
have	X
cerebral	X
palsy	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
is	X
given	X
to	X
people	X
with	X
many	X
different	X
disabilities	X
.	X

The	X
recipients	X
of	X
ILF	X
are	X
often	X
said	X
to	X
be	X
some	X
of	X
the	X
most	X
severely	X
disabled	X
people	X
in	X
the	X
UK	X
.	X

Predominantly	X
,	X
it	X
has	X
been	X
used	X
to	X
help	X
people	X
pay	X
for	X
carers	X
and	X
personal	X
assistants	X
,	X
and	X
its	X
aim	X
was	X
to	X
ensure	X
that	X
these	X
disabled	X
people	X
could	X
live	X
in	X
their	X
communities	X
,	X
rather	X
than	X
in	X
residential	X
care	X
homes	X
.	X

It	X
has	X
been	X
seen	X
,	X
in	X
the	X
most	X
part	X
,	X
as	X
a	X
top-up	X
fund	X
,	X
giving	X
extra	X
money	X
to	X
disabled	X
people	X
in	X
addition	X
to	X
the	X
benefits	X
they	X
receive	X
from	X
local	X
authorities	X
,	X
to	X
ensure	X
they	X
can	X
afford	X
care	X
.	X

Why	X
is	X
it	X
closing	X
?	X

The	X
government	X
says	X
the	X
needs	X
of	X
recipients	X
could	X
be	X
met	X
more	X
effectively	X
by	X
money	X
coming	X
from	X
one	X
,	X
unified	X
system	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
because	X
94	X
%	X
of	X
the	X
current	X
users	X
already	X
receive	X
benefits	X
from	X
their	X
local	X
authorities	X
,	X
so	X
,	X
according	X
to	X
the	X
government	X
,	X
it	X
makes	X
sense	X
and	X
stops	X
unnecessary	X
bureaucracy	X
,	X
if	X
all	X
funding	X
comes	X
from	X
the	X
same	X
place	X
.	X

The	X
government	X
also	X
says	X
that	X
for	X
some	X
time	X
it	X
has	X
been	X
clear	X
that	X
developments	X
in	X
the	X
delivery	X
of	X
care	X
and	X
support	X
-	X
specifically	X
,	X
that	X
people	X
now	X
receive	X
personal	X
budgets	X
from	X
local	X
authorities	X
-	X
have	X
meant	X
the	X
objective	X
of	X
the	X
ILF	X
could	X
now	X
be	X
better	X
met	X
by	X
local	X
authorities	X
.	X

The	X
ILF	X
has	X
for	X
many	X
years	X
been	X
seen	X
as	X
an	X
anomaly	X
,	X
always	X
operating	X
outside	X
of	X
local	X
authority	X
budgeting	X
.	X

In	X
1988	X
,	X
when	X
the	X
ILF	X
was	X
set	X
up	X
,	X
it	X
was	X
illegal	X
for	X
local	X
authorities	X
to	X
give	X
money	X
to	X
people	X
directly	X
.	X

But	X
because	X
that	X
has	X
not	X
been	X
the	X
case	X
since	X
1996	X
,	X
and	X
because	X
local	X
authorities	X
already	X
spend	X
Â£	X
1.2bn	X
a	X
year	X
to	X
support	X
disabled	X
people	X
of	X
all	X
ages	X
,	X
the	X
government	X
argues	X
it	X
no	X
longer	X
makes	X
sense	X
.	X

What	X
will	X
change	X
?	X

And	X
the	X
money	X
does	X
not	X
have	X
to	X
be	X
ring-fenced	X

it	X

by	X

The	X
government	X
's	X
response	X
to	X
calls	X
to	X
ring-fence	X
the	X

has	X
been	X
clear	X

local	X

from	X
servicing	X
local	X

a	X
flexible	X

way	X

some	X

could	X
be	X
a	X
smokescreen	X

campaigners	X
say	X
that	X

practice	X
the	X
picture	X

argue	X
that	X
social	X

being	X
squeezed	X
more	X

that	X

way	X
for	X

expect	X

ongoing	X
legal	X
battle	X

government	X
over	X
the	X
ILF	X

which	X
was	X
only	X
resolved	X
in	X
December	X
2014	X
.	X

Five	X
disabled	X
ILF	X
users	X
brought	X
a	X
case	X
against	X
the	X
government	X
's	X
plans	X
to	X
scrap	X
the	X
fund	X
,	X
in	X
2013	X
,	X
questioning	X
the	X
legality	X
of	X
the	X
decision	X
on	X
the	X
basis	X
that	X
the	X
consultation	X
into	X
how	X
it	X
would	X
work	X
had	X
been	X
inadequate	X
and	X
had	X
failed	X
to	X
fulfil	X
its	X
public-sector	X
equality	X
duty	X
.	X

The	X
High	X
Court	X
found	X
that	X
the	X
closure	X
was	X
lawful	X
,	X
but	X
this	X
decision	X
was	X
later	X
overturned	X
by	X
the	X
Court	X
of	X
Appeal	X
.	X

The	X
government	X
then	X
decided	X
it	X
would	X
not	X
appeal	X
and	X
ministers	X
began	X
to	X
reconsider	X
the	X
future	X
of	X
ILF	X
.	X

But	X
the	X
Department	X
for	X
Work	X
and	X
Pensions	X
conducted	X
fresh	X
equalities	X
analysis	X
following	X
the	X
Court	X
of	X
Appeal	X
's	X
decision	X
,	X
which	X
resulted	X
in	X
the	X
government	X
announcing	X
once	X
more	X
,	X
in	X
March	X
2014	X
,	X
that	X
the	X
ILF	X
would	X
close	X
.	X

A	X
fresh	X
legal	X
challenge	X
from	X
ILF	X
users	X
was	X
brought	X
against	X
the	X
decision	X
but	X
was	X
ultimately	X
unsuccessful	X
,	X
and	X
in	X
December	X
2014	X
,	X
the	X
High	X
Court	X
ruled	X
it	X
was	X
lawful	X
once	X
again	X

this	X

going	X

since	X
the	X

was	X

it	X
does	X
not	X

His	X

Richard	X
Selby	X

says	X
the	X
new	X
method	X
of	X
combating	X
the	X

by	X
going	X
after	X
the	X
tsetse	X
fly	X
by	X
rivers	X
,	X

swamps	X
is	X
cheap	X
as	X
well	X
as	X
effective	X
.	X

"	X
The	X
flies	X
are	X
attracted	X
to	X
the	X
blue	X
material	X
,	X
they	X
circle	X
it	X
and	X
land	X
on	X
a	X
black	X
netting	X
attached	X
to	X
it	X
which	X
they	X
ca	X
n't	X
see	X

"	X
They	X
hit	X
that	X

it	X

covered	X
in	X
insecticide	X
,	X
they	X
pick	X
up	X
the	X
chemical	X

fly	X
off	X

within	X
three	X
minutes	X

"	X

Early	X
monitoring	X
of	X
the	X
success	X
of	X
the	X
targets	X
suggests	X
that	X
they	X
are	X
having	X
a	X
"	X
huge	X
impact	X
"	X
,	X
Dr	X
Selby	X
says	X
,	X
reducing	X
the	X
fly	X
population	X
by	X
around	X
90	X
%	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
possible	X
because	X
the	X
tsetse	X
fly	X
is	X
very	X
sensitive	X
to	X
insecticide	X
and	X
an	X
extremely	X
slow	X
breeder	X
,	X
producing	X
just	X
one	X
live	X
offspring	X
every	X
nine	X
days	X

Mosquitoes	X
,	X
in	X
contrast	X
,	X
produce	X
hundreds	X
in	X
the	X
same	X
timeframe	X

What	X
's	X
more	X
challenging	X
is	X
reaching	X
the	X
places	X
where	X
the	X
flies	X
live	X
and	X
breed	X
,	X
because	X
they	X
tend	X
to	X
be	X
remote	X
and	X
difficult	X
to	X
access	X
.	X

But	X
it	X
is	X
communities	X
in	X
rural	X
areas	X
of	X
sub-Saharan	X
Africa	X
,	X
who	X
depend	X
on	X
agriculture	X

most	X
at	X

Washed	X

In	X
northern	X
Uganda	X
,	X
Dr	X
Selby	X
says	X
local	X
people	X
have	X
bought	X
into	X
the	X
idea	X
of	X
the	X
blue	X
targets	X
,	X
allowing	X
the	X
research	X
team	X
to	X
enrol	X
the	X
help	X
of	X
local	X
government	X
officials	X
in	X
placing	X
them	X
.	X

This	X
means	X
the	X
project	X
team	X
can	X
begin	X
to	X
step	X
back	X
and	X
let	X
local	X
teams	X
take	X
on	X
the	X
tsetse	X
fly	X
.	X

The	X
targets	X
wo	X
n't	X
last	X
forever	X
though	X
,	X
he	X
explains	X
.	X

"	X
If	X
placed	X
well	X
,	X
they	X
will	X
last	X
about	X
five	X
months	X
.	X

Because	X
they	X
need	X
to	X
be	X
near	X
water	X
they	X
are	X
usually	X
washed	X
away	X
during	X

Screening	X
for	X
sleeping	X
sickness	X
is	X
not	X
easy	X
in	X
the	X
early	X
stages	X
of	X
the	X
disease	X

A	X
few	X
kilometres	X
from	X
Arua	X
,	X
in	X
Omugu	X
,	X
the	X
Liverpool	X
team	X
have	X
also	X
been	X
testing	X
the	X
blood	X
of	X
villagers	X
to	X
accurately	X
assess	X
the	X
current	X
scale	X
of	X
sleeping	X
sickness	X
-	X
and	X
they	X
will	X
do	X
the	X
same	X
tests	X
again	X
in	X
18	X
months	X
to	X
see	X
how	X
effective	X
the	X
targets	X
have	X
been	X
.	X

Picking	X
up	X
the	X
presence	X
of	X
the	X
parasite	X
in	X
the	X
blood	X
is	X
difficult	X
in	X
the	X
early	X
stages	X
of	X
the	X
disease	X
.	X

If	X
the	X
disease	X
is	X
left	X
to	X
develop	X
,	X
however	X
,	X
the	X
parasite	X
will	X
multiply	X
and	X
cross	X
into	X
the	X
brain	X
to	X
infect	X
the	X
central	X
nervous	X
system	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
when	X
more	X
obvious	X
signs	X
of	X
the	X
disease	X
appear	X
,	X
such	X
as	X
confusion	X
,	X
changes	X
in	X
behaviour	X
,	X
and	X
disturbances	X
in	X
sleep	X
patterns	X
,	X
which	X
give	X
it	X
its	X
name	X
.	X

At	X
this	X
stage	X
,	X
without	X
treatment	X
,	X
sleeping	X
sickness	X
normally	X
ends	X
in	X
death	X
.	X

new	X
drug	X
to	X
treat	X
sleeping	X
sickness	X
is	X
in	X
the	X

because	X
it	X
is	X
taken	X
orally	X
rather	X
than	X
intravenously	X
,	X
it	X
holds	X
great	X
promise	X
and	X
should	X
save	X
lives	X
.	X

Combining	X
screening	X
and	X
treatment	X
with	X
controlling	X
the	X
fly	X
population	X
appears	X
to	X
be	X
the	X
best	X
way	X
of	X
trying	X
to	X
eliminate	X
the	X

about	X

next	X

up	X

.	X

Since	X

seen	X
an	X

easier	X
to	X
borrow	X
in	X
order	X
to	X
do	X
so	X
.	X

Now	X

are	X
taking	X
to	X

urge	X

to	X
hold	X

Since	X

the	X

encouraged	X
a	X

a	X

the	X

agree	X
exactly	X

the	X

actually	X
is	X

but	X
everyone	X
agrees	X
that	X
it	X
's	X
getting	X
shorter	X

According	X
to	X
the	X
Beijing	X

,	X
about	X
30	X

of	X
the	X
Ming	X
dynasty	X

has	X
disappeared	X
due	X
to	X

reckless	X

The	X
paper	X
quoted	X
dire	X
warnings	X
from	X

that	X
"	X

Taking	X

How	X
does	X
this	X
show	X
differ	X
from	X
your	X
other	X
TV	X
and	X
live	X
shows	X
?	X

The	X
great	X
thing	X
about	X
this	X
show	X
is	X
it	X
's	X
looking	X
at	X
the	X
early	X
years	X
of	X
the	X
character	X
Mr	X
Tumble	X
,	X
which	X
is	X
really	X
fun	X
.	X

But	X
the	X
most	X
exciting	X
part	X
of	X
the	X
show	X
is	X
we	X
have	X
a	X
signing	X
choir	X
on	X
stage	X
.	X

We	X
're	X
using	X
children	X
from	X
schools	X
around	X
the	X
area	X
.	X

We	X
use	X
the	X
Makaton	X
signing	X
system	X
,	X
which	X
helps	X
children	X
have	X
a	X
voice	X
.	X

If	X
a	X
child	X
ca	X
n't	X
vocalise	X
,	X
they	X
can	X
use	X
their	X
hands	X
to	X
tell	X
us	X
what	X
they	X
want	X
and	X
that	X
relieves	X
the	X
frustration	X
.	X

Is	X
there	X
a	X
child	X
actor	X
playing	X
Master	X
Tumble	X
?	X

Yes	X
.	X

We	X
've	X
got	X
a	X
little	X
chap	X
I	X
worked	X
with	X
on	X
one	X
of	X
my	X
other	X
programmes	X
,	X
Gigglebiz	X
.	X

In	X
fact	X
,	X
we	X
've	X
got	X
two	X
actors	X
.	X

And	X
we	X
've	X
got	X
some	X
other	X
lovely	X
character	X
actors	X
-	X
we	X
've	X
got	X
Ronni	X
Ancona	X
coming	X
in	X
to	X
play	X
the	X
headmistress	X
of	X
the	X
school	X
,	X
so	X
that	X
should	X
be	X
good	X
fun	X
.	X

Do	X
you	X
still	X
enjoy	X
being	X
on	X
children	X
's	X
TV	X
?	X

Oh	X
,	X
I	X
love	X
it	X
.	X

The	X
reaction	X
we	X
get	X
from	X
the	X
children	X
,	X
the	X
families	X
,	X
the	X
teachers	X
,	X
everyone	X
,	X
is	X
incredible	X
.	X

When	X
you	X
get	X
emails	X
daily	X
saying	X
:	X
"	X
My	X
child	X
has	X
spoken	X
for	X
the	X
first	X
time	X
after	X
watching	X
this	X
programme	X

it	X
's	X
a	X
very	X
important	X
thing	X
,	X
and	X
it	X
's	X
important	X
that	X
we	X
carry	X
on	X
this	X
programme	X
.	X

It	X
helps	X
so	X
many	X
children	X
.	X

Do	X
children	X
or	X
parents	X
get	X
more	X
excited	X
when	X
they	X
spot	X
you	X
in	X
real	X
life	X
?	X

I	X
do	X
n't	X
know	X
.	X

I	X
'll	X
get	X
lots	X
of	X
people	X
shouting	X
across	X
the	X
road	X
.	X

I	X
might	X
be	X
in	X
the	X
supermarket	X
or	X
whatever	X
and	X
they	X
'll	X
go	X
:	X
"	X
Hi	X
Mr	X
Tumble	X
!	X
!	X

I	X
went	X
to	X
a	X
fete	X
with	X
my	X
niece	X
,	X
and	X
we	X
were	X
walking	X
into	X
the	X
entrance	X
to	X
the	X
fete	X
and	X
someone	X
went	X
:	X
"	X
Hey	X
Mr	X
Tumble	X
!	X
!	X

And	X
Lara	X
said	X
to	X
me	X
:	X
"	X
Is	X
Mr	X
Tumble	X
here	X
?	X

Where	X
is	X
he	X
?	X

We	X
've	X
got	X
to	X
go	X
and	X
see	X
him	X
quick	X
.	X
"	X

And	X
I	X
was	X
thinking	X
:	X
"	X
Wow	X
,	X
we	X
need	X
to	X
find	X
a	X
phone	X

I	X

Do	X
actors	X
on	X
children	X
's	X
TV	X
get	X
same	X
credit	X

those	X
on	X

drama	X
?	X

I	X
do	X
n't	X
know	X

I	X
've	X
found	X
my	X
niche	X
.	X

I	X
know	X
what	X
I	X
love	X
doing	X
.	X

And	X
the	X
key	X
is	X
not	X
sitting	X
still	X
.	X

Every	X
few	X
years	X
,	X
I	X
like	X
to	X
reinvent	X
myself	X
.	X

I	X
like	X
to	X
come	X
up	X
with	X
new	X
ideas	X
,	X
new	X

new	X
characters	X

That	X
's	X
important	X

Fletcher	X

People	X
assume	X
that	X
children	X
's	X
TV	X
is	X
quick	X
and	X
easy	X
,	X
but	X
is	X
there	X
a	X
craft	X
to	X
it	X
?	X

Yes	X
.	X

Slapstick	X
is	X
tricky	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
all	X
about	X
timing	X
,	X
and	X
it	X
takes	X
quite	X
a	X
long	X
time	X
to	X
film	X
.	X

We	X
tend	X
to	X
do	X
it	X
on	X
one	X
single	X
camera	X
because	X
you	X
get	X
a	X
lot	X
more	X
without	X
the	X
editing	X
,	X
and	X
that	X
goes	X
back	X
to	X
the	X
days	X
of	X
Laurel	X
and	X
Hardy	X
,	X
(	X
Buster	X
)	X
Keaton	X
(	X
and	X
Charlie	X
)	X
Chaplin	X
,	X
who	X
mostly	X
filmed	X
with	X
just	X
one	X
camera	X
on	X
a	X
mid-shot	X

How	X
about	X
a	X
more	X
radical	X
change	X
of	X
direction	X
,	X
to	X
straight	X
acting	X
?	X

Yeah	X
,	X
or	X
adult	X
comedy	X
.	X

Of	X
course	X
I	X
would	X
look	X
at	X
that	X
.	X

I	X
would	X
never	X
leave	X
children	X
's	X
completely	X
.	X

Never	X
would	X
.	X

Because	X
I	X
love	X
it	X
,	X
that	X
's	X
what	X
I	X
do	X
.	X

But	X
I	X
've	X
spoken	X
to	X
some	X
lovely	X
people	X
who	X
I	X
've	X
got	X
to	X
know	X
over	X
the	X
years	X
,	X
like	X
Peter	X
Kay	X
,	X
and	X
who	X
knows	X
,	X
if	X
something	X
came	X
up	X
that	X
's	X
right	X
for	X
me	X
,	X
of	X
course	X
I	X
'd	X
look	X
at	X
it	X
because	X
it	X
would	X
be	X
a	X
real	X
challenge	X
for	X
me	X
and	X
take	X
me	X
out	X
of	X
my	X
comfort	X
zone	X
.	X

Do	X
n't	X
you	X
ever	X
get	X
sick	X
of	X
having	X
to	X
be	X
so	X
happy	X
?	X

No	X
,	X
no	X
.	X

I	X
realise	X
I	X
'm	X
very	X
lucky	X
doing	X
something	X
I	X
love	X
doing	X
,	X
but	X
I	X
work	X
hard	X
at	X
it	X
and	X
I	X
really	X
try	X
and	X
make	X
programmes	X
that	X
are	X
watchable	X
not	X
just	X
for	X
children	X
but	X
for	X
everyone	X

What	X
do	X
you	X
do	X
in	X
your	X
spare	X
time	X
?	X

I	X
'm	X
45	X
now	X
,	X
and	X
,	X
as	X
you	X
get	X
older	X
,	X
when	X
you	X
do	X
all	X
the	X
falls	X
and	X
slapstick	X
work	X
and	X
go	X
onto	X
crash	X
mats	X
,	X
you	X
get	X
a	X
bit	X
slow	X
at	X
getting	X
up	X
,	X
because	X
it	X
is	X
a	X
very	X
physical	X
,	X
demanding	X
role	X
.	X

I	X
've	X
got	X
a	X
lovely	X
family	X
around	X
me	X
.	X

I	X
do	X
country	X
walks	X
.	X

I	X
go	X
fishing	X
a	X
bit	X
.	X

I	X
take	X
the	X
dogs	X
for	X
a	X
walk	X
.	X

I	X
visit	X
friends	X
,	X
and	X
I	X
'm	X
trying	X
to	X
give	X
myself	X
a	X
bit	X
more	X
time	X
off	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
always	X
seems	X
to	X
fail	X
because	X
I	X
am	X
a	X
bit	X
of	X
a	X
workaholic	X
.	X

What	X
's	X
your	X
biggest	X
vice	X
?	X

Being	X
a	X
workaholic	X
does	X
n't	X
count	X
.	X

I	X
'm	X
quite	X
into	X
classic	X
cars	X
.	X

I	X
'm	X
quite	X
fascinated	X
by	X
things	X
like	X
that	X
.	X

And	X
I	X
love	X
film	X
music	X
.	X

Film	X
music	X
is	X
so	X
important	X
to	X
me	X
.	X

I	X
was	X
brought	X
up	X
in	X
the	X
music	X
industry	X
.	X

My	X
father	X
's	X
a	X
songwriter	X
.	X

So	X
most	X
of	X
my	X
ideas	X
come	X
from	X
listening	X
to	X
music	X
,	X
and	X
most	X
of	X
that	X
is	X
film	X
music	X
.	X

How	X
many	X
cars	X
have	X
you	X
got	X
?	X

I	X
've	X
got	X
a	X
couple	X
of	X
prop	X
cars	X
.	X

They	X
're	X
two	X
minis	X
-	X
they	X
've	X
been	X
cut	X
in	X
half	X
and	X
then	X
put	X
back	X
together	X
so	X
they	X
're	X
tiny	X
.	X

They	X
've	X
got	X
little	X
eyes	X
as	X
well	X
.	X

And	X
I	X
've	X
got	X
five	X
1950s	X
bumper	X
cars	X
.	X

And	X
I	X
've	X
got	X
a	X
little	X
MGB	X
.	X

So	X
I	X
tinker	X
around	X
with	X
those	X
cars	X
when	X
I	X
've	X
got	X
a	X
minute	X

was	X

that	X
India	X

freshly	X
freed	X

was	X
ashamed	X

nothing	X

however	X

went	X
ahead	X

commemorated	X

In	X
the	X
absence	X
of	X
a	X
national	X
war	X
memorial	X
,	X
many	X
Indians	X
like	X
myself	X
see	X
it	X
as	X
the	X
only	X
venue	X
to	X
pay	X
homage	X
to	X
those	X
who	X
have	X
lost	X
their	X
lives	X
in	X
more	X
recent	X
conflicts	X
.	X

I	X
have	X
stood	X
there	X
many	X
times	X
,	X
on	X
the	X
anniversaries	X
of	X
wars	X
with	X
China	X
and	X
Pakistan	X
,	X
and	X
bowed	X
my	X
head	X
without	X
a	X
thought	X
for	X
the	X
men	X
who	X
died	X
in	X
foreign	X
fields	X
a	X
century	X
ago	X
.	X

As	X
a	X
member	X
of	X
parliament	X
,	X
I	X
twice	X
raised	X
the	X
demand	X
for	X
a	X
national	X
war	X
memorial	X
(	X
after	X
a	X
visit	X
to	X
the	X
hugely	X
impressive	X
Australian	X
one	X
in	X
Canberra	X
)	X
and	X
was	X
told	X
there	X
were	X
no	X
plans	X
to	X
construct	X
one	X
here	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
therefore	X
personally	X
satisfying	X
to	X
me	X
,	X
and	X
to	X
many	X
of	X
my	X
compatriots	X
,	X
when	X
the	X
government	X
of	X
India	X
announced	X
in	X
its	X
budget	X
for	X
2014-15	X
its	X
intention	X
finally	X
to	X
create	X
a	X
national	X
war	X
memorial	X
.	X

We	X
are	X
not	X
a	X
terribly	X
militaristic	X
society	X
,	X
but	X
for	X
a	X
nation	X
that	X
has	X
fought	X
many	X
wars	X
and	X
shed	X
the	X
blood	X
of	X
many	X
heroes	X
,	X
and	X
whose	X
resolve	X
may	X
yet	X
be	X
tested	X
in	X
conflicts	X
to	X
come	X
,	X
it	X
seems	X
odd	X
that	X
there	X
is	X
no	X
memorial	X
to	X
commemorate	X
,	X
honour	X
and	X
preserve	X
the	X
memories	X
of	X
those	X
who	X
have	X
fought	X
for	X
India	X
.	X

The	X
centenary	X
is	X
finally	X
forcing	X
a	X
rethink	X
.	X

Remarkable	X
photographs	X
have	X
been	X
unearthed	X
of	X
Indian	X
soldiers	X
in	X
Europe	X
and	X
the	X
Middle	X
East	X
,	X
and	X
these	X
are	X
enjoying	X
a	X
new	X
lease	X
of	X
life	X
online	X
.	X

Looking	X
at	X
them	X
,	X
I	X
find	X
it	X
impossible	X
not	X
to	X
be	X
moved	X
-	X
these	X
young	X
men	X
,	X
visibly	X
so	X
alien	X
to	X
their	X
surroundings	X
,	X
some	X
about	X
to	X
head	X
off	X
for	X
battle	X
,	X
others	X
nursing	X
terrible	X
wounds	X

My	X
favourite	X
picture	X

his	X

This	X
spirit	X
of	X
compassion	X
has	X
been	X
repeatedly	X
expressed	X
by	X
Indian	X
peacekeeping	X
units	X
in	X

curiosity	X
has	X
overcome	X
the	X
fading	X
colonial-era	X
resentments	X
of	X
British	X

are	X
beginning	X
to	X
see	X

of	X

One	X
as	X

that	X

that	X

they	X

John	X

's	X

that	X
Germany	X
had	X
about	X
15,000	X
soldiers	X
in	X
south-west	X
Tanzania	X
in	X
1916	X
out	X
of	X
whom	X
about	X
3,000	X
were	X

the	X
remaining	X
12,000	X
were	X
Tanzanians	X
whose	X
names	X
are	X

The	X
Tanzanian	X
carrier	X
corps	X
also	X
played	X
a	X
central	X
role	X
in	X
sustaining	X
the	X
war	X

Their	X
story	X
should	X
be	X
recovered	X

It	X
is	X
estimated	X
that	X
during	X
the	X
peak	X
of	X
military	X
operations	X
in	X
1916	X
the	X
German	X

state	X
conscripted	X
some	X
45,000	X

members	X

let	X
's	X
not	X

the	X
general	X
public	X

grew	X

raised	X

on	X
this	X

feed	X

forces	X
in	X
Tanzania	X
and	X
the	X
invading	X
British	X
forces	X
from	X

engaged	X

these	X

acts	X

looting	X

of	X
the	X
generation	X

my	X
great-grandparents	X
,	X
creating	X
a	X
food	X
shortage	X
which	X
my	X
grandfather	X
spoke	X
about	X
.	X

But	X
perhaps	X
the	X
most	X
surprising	X
element	X
in	X
this	X
elusive	X
story	X
is	X
a	X
silence	X
of	X
the	X
names	X
and	X
identities	X
of	X
African	X
soldiers	X
and	X
carriers	X
in	X
the	X
oral	X
history	X
itself	X
.	X

I	X
find	X
this	X
to	X
be	X
surprising	X
and	X
unique	X
because	X
Tanzanian	X
soldiers	X
and	X
leaders	X
who	X
participated	X
in	X
other	X
military	X
engagements	X
are	X
known	X
and	X
remembered	X
.	X

For	X
example	X
,	X
some	X
of	X
the	X
names	X
and	X
identities	X
of	X
Tanzanians	X
who	X
fought	X
in	X
the	X
Maji	X
Maji	X
wars	X
of	X
resistance	X
in	X
Southern	X
Tanzania	X
from	X
1905	X
to	X
1907	X
are	X
known	X
and	X
remembered	X
.	X

Maji	X
Maji	X
wars	X
were	X
local	X
protests	X
against	X
German	X
colonial	X
exploitation	X
,	X
oppression	X
,	X
and	X
forced	X
cultivation	X
of	X
cotton	X
.	X

The	X
resistance	X
was	X
sparked	X
by	X
a	X
charismatic	X
spiritual	X
leader	X
Kinjekitile	X
Ngwale	X
who	X
claimed	X
to	X
possess	X
medicine	X
which	X
would	X
protect	X
warriors	X
against	X
German	X
bullets	X
,	X
turning	X
them	X

Maji	X
is	X
the	X
Kiswahili	X
word	X
for	X
water	X
.	X

Many	X
people	X
died	X
as	X
bullets	X
never	X
changed	X
into	X
water	X
.	X

Maji	X
Maji	X
remains	X
a	X
heroic	X
story	X
in	X
Tanzania	X
,	X
which	X
is	X
taught	X
to	X
every	X
young	X
Tanzanian	X
in	X
primary	X
and	X
secondary	X
school	X
.	X

Kinjekitile	X
Ngwale	X
is	X
celebrated	X
and	X
romanticised	X
for	X
his	X
readiness	X
to	X
die	X
in	X
order	X
to	X
preserve	X
the	X
independence	X
,	X
autonomy	X
,	X
and	X
respect	X
of	X
Africans	X
.	X

The	X
Maji	X
Maji	X
museum	X
in	X
Songea	X
was	X
built	X
to	X
celebrate	X
the	X
heroic	X
lives	X
of	X
soldiers	X
and	X
leaders	X
of	X
the	X
war	X
-	X
it	X
contains	X
narratives	X
,	X
sculptures	X
,	X
and	X
even	X
pictures	X
of	X
these	X
heroes	X
.	X

Each	X
year	X
there	X
is	X
a	X
month-long	X
commemoration	X
of	X

So	X
why	X
is	X
the	X
story	X
so	X
different	X
for	X
World	X
War	X
One	X
?	X

Why	X
are	X
the	X
names	X
and	X
identities	X
of	X
thousands	X
of	X
Tanzanians	X
who	X
served	X
as	X
soldiers	X
and	X
carrier	X
corps	X
unknown	X
?	X

Perhaps	X
this	X
is	X
because	X
they	X
were	X
not	X
appreciated	X
by	X
Germany	X
.	X

In	X
some	X
oral	X
accounts	X
Germany	X
even	X
held	X
them	X
responsible	X
for	X
Germany	X
not	X
winning	X
the	X
war	X
.	X

Kaswashi	X
Pwele	X
claimed	X
that	X
"	X
German	X
military	X
officials	X
blamed	X
Africans	X
for	X
not	X
winning	X
the	X
war	X
.	X

They	X
accused	X
some	X
Africans	X
for	X
lacking	X
loyalty	X
to	X
Germany	X
and	X
for	X
leaking	X
security	X
information	X
to	X
Britain	X
.	X
"	X

But	X
is	X
n't	X
the	X
key	X
reason	X
for	X
the	X
invisibility	X
of	X
the	X
names	X
and	X
identities	X
of	X
Tanzanian	X
soldiers	X
and	X
carrier	X
corps	X
to	X
be	X
found	X
in	X
the	X
attitude	X
of	X
the	X
British	X
colonial	X
state	X
which	X
took	X
over	X
from	X
the	X
Germans	X
?	X

Elders	X
told	X
me	X
the	X
British	X
were	X
very	X
suspicious	X
of	X
Africans	X
who	X
had	X
worked	X
for	X
the	X
Germans	X
.	X

Soldiers	X
and	X
carrier	X
corps	X
who	X
served	X
in	X
the	X
German	X
army	X
were	X
the	X
least	X
trusted	X
.	X

According	X
to	X
the	X
elders	X
,	X
some	X
of	X
these	X
soldiers	X
and	X
carrier	X
corps	X
were	X
deported	X
to	X
Nyasaland	X
.	X

Some	X
were	X
detained	X
for	X
some	X
years	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
risky	X
to	X
be	X
labelled	X
a	X
pro-German	X
royalist	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
dangerous	X
.	X

As	X
a	X
coping	X
strategy	X
,	X
many	X
men	X
who	X
had	X
participated	X
in	X
the	X
war	X
on	X
the	X
German	X
side	X
made	X
"	X
creative	X
adaptations	X
"	X
by	X
concealing	X
their	X
identities	X
and	X
war	X
experience	X
.	X

"	X
Creative	X
adaptations	X
"	X
-	X
it	X
's	X
another	X
way	X
to	X
say	X
"	X
hiding	X
the	X
truth	X
"	X
,	X
perhaps	X
a	X
polite	X
expression	X
for	X
lying	X
.	X

I	X
have	X
translated	X
creative	X
adaptations	X
from	X
the	X
word	X
ubhuche	X
,	X
in	X
the	X
Ndali	X
language	X
,	X
my	X
mother	X
tongue	X
and	X
the	X
language	X
used	X
by	X
elders	X
I	X
spoke	X
to	X
.	X

Ubhuche	X
helped	X
people	X
to	X
avoid	X
the	X
dangers	X
of	X
a	X
new	X
colonial	X
regime	X
.	X

This	X
helped	X
them	X
to	X
live	X
peacefully	X
and	X
to	X
prosper	X
under	X
British	X
colonialism	X
.	X

They	X
also	X
learned	X
to	X
speak	X
negatively	X
about	X
German	X
colonialism	X
,	X
even	X
those	X
who	X
had	X
individually	X
benefited	X
from	X
it	X
.	X

The	X
silences	X
on	X
the	X
names	X
and	X
identities	X
we	X
see	X
today	X
are	X
probably	X
the	X
result	X
of	X
this	X
creative	X
adaptation	X
of	X
African	X
soldiers	X
and	X
carrier	X
corps	X
to	X
the	X
British	X
colonial	X
regime	X
after	X
the	X
war	X
.	X

It	X
might	X
be	X
too	X
late	X
to	X
interview	X
the	X
eye	X
witnesses	X
but	X
listening	X
closely	X
,	X
creatively	X
,	X
and	X
critically	X
to	X
our	X
elders	X
,	X
we	X
can	X
still	X
hear	X
echoes	X
of	X
the	X
voices	X
of	X
African	X
soldiers	X
,	X
carrier	X
corps	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
larger	X
public	X
during	X
World	X
War	X
One	X
.	X

Let	X
me	X
conclude	X
by	X
reflecting	X
on	X
that	X
visit	X
I	X
made	X
to	X
the	X
south	X
west	X
.	X

I	X
'm	X
going	X
to	X
make	X
Ubhuche	X
-	X
a	X
Creative	X
Adaptation	X
of	X
my	X
own	X
-	X
I	X
'm	X
going	X
to	X
adapt	X
what	X
I	X
've	X
learnt	X
from	X
research	X
to	X
imagine	X
the	X
invisible	X
stories	X
of	X
World	X
War	X
One	X
.	X

Standing	X
in	X
the	X
World	X
War	X
One	X
battlefields	X
at	X
Kasumulu	X
,	X
I	X
could	X
see	X
the	X
River	X
Songwe	X
that	X
the	X
British	X
and	X
German	X
colonisers	X
used	X
to	X
divide	X
our	X
great-grandparents	X
as	X
different	X
people	X
:	X
as	X
either	X
Tanzanians	X
or	X
Malawians	X
.	X

I	X
also	X
saw	X
a	X
glimpse	X
of	X
a	X
soldier	X
from	X
a	X
century	X
past	X
,	X
standing	X
with	X
his	X
rifle	X
.	X

Next	X
to	X
him	X
,	X
a	X
carrier	X
with	X
supplies	X
for	X
the	X
colonial	X
army	X
on	X
his	X
head	X
and	X
back	X
.	X

I	X
imagine	X
them	X
as	X
proud	X
men	X
of	X
values	X
.	X

They	X
accepted	X
the	X
war	X
,	X
probably	X
reluctantly	X
,	X
and	X
went	X
to	X
fight	X
against	X
British	X
Malawian	X
soldiers	X
,	X
perhaps	X
their	X
cousins	X
who	X
lived	X
on	X
the	X
other	X
side	X
of	X
the	X
River	X
Songwe	X
.	X

They	X
have	X
no	X
military	X
uniform	X
.	X

They	X
fought	X
in	X
traditional	X
dress	X
.	X

I	X
know	X
some	X
killed	X
enemies	X
,	X
and	X
some	X
of	X
them	X
died	X
.	X

And	X
when	X
I	X
think	X
of	X
them	X
,	X
I	X
do	X
n't	X
think	X
only	X
of	X
the	X
conflict	X
they	X
fought	X
in	X
,	X
but	X
also	X
the	X
inner	X
conflict	X
that	X
they	X
combated	X
at	X
the	X
end	X
of	X
the	X
war	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
important	X
for	X
me	X
to	X
remember	X
the	X
public	X
too	X
,	X
the	X
impact	X
on	X
my	X
great-grandmother	X
and	X
her	X
children	X
during	X
the	X
war	X
.	X

I	X
imagine	X
the	X
ordinary	X
men	X
,	X
women	X
,	X
and	X
children	X
in	X
those	X
hills	X
,	X
plains	X
,	X
and	X
along	X
the	X
river	X
.	X

They	X
were	X
full	X
of	X
fear	X
and	X
insecurity	X
,	X
they	X
suffered	X
from	X
acute	X
food	X
shortage	X
,	X
had	X
their	X
houses	X
burned	X
by	X
combatants	X
,	X
they	X
were	X
exhausted	X
by	X
war	X
traumas	X
.	X

Women	X
and	X
children	X
were	X
probably	X
at	X
the	X
highest	X
risk	X
from	X
this	X
global	X
crisis	X
that	X
unfolded	X
in	X
their	X
villages	X
.	X

But	X
I	X
know	X
that	X
just	X
as	X
my	X
people	X
suffered	X
in	X
this	X
war	X
,	X
many	X
also	X
survived	X
and	X
overcame	X
the	X
challenges	X
.	X

Their	X
creative	X
adaptations	X
,	X
the	X
Ubhuche	X
,	X
helped	X
them	X
to	X
endure	X
and	X
prosper	X
.	X

They	X
may	X
be	X
invisible	X
in	X
the	X
mainstream	X
history	X
.	X

Let	X
us	X
not	X
forget	X
them	X

Kenyans	X
are	X
great	X
runners	X

to	X
run	X

something	X

over	X

they	X
have	X
been	X

away	X

but	X
their	X
biggest	X
interest	X
becomes	X
prime	X
public	X
land	X
,	X
prompting	X
their	X
mouths	X
to	X
salivate	X
with	X
desire	X
.	X

So	X
when	X
the	X
three	X
most	X
popular	X
national	X
television	X
stations	X
,	X
Citizen	X
TV	X
,	X
KTN	X
TV	X

Nation	X
TV	X
,	X
and	X
its	X
subsidiary	X
Q-TV	X
,	X
switched	X
off	X
their	X
broadcasts	X
in	X
a	X
row	X
over	X
the	X
move	X
from	X
analogue	X
to	X
digital	X
transmission	X
,	X
most	X
Kenyans	X
were	X
relieved	X
to	X
see	X
their	X
politicians	X
wiped	X
off	X
their	X
screens	X
.	X

The	X
political	X
vitriol	X
and	X
vanity	X
that	X
had	X
become	X
a	X
staple	X
diet	X
for	X
TV	X
consumers	X
took	X
a	X
break	X
.	X

One	X
young	X
office	X
receptionist	X
told	X
me	X
:	X
"	X
I	X
have	X
n't	X
heard	X
any	X
silly	X
politics	X
in	X
three	X
weeks	X
,	X
I	X
did	X
n't	X
realise	X
that	X
it	X
's	X
politicians	X
who	X
force	X
it	X
on	X
my	X
screen	X
.	X
"	X

Honourable	X
?	X

Shortly	X
before	X
the	X
big	X
TV	X
switch-off	X
,	X
the	X
level	X
of	X
political	X
debate	X
in	X
parliament	X
had	X
been	X
lowered	X
to	X
unbelievable	X
levels	X
.	X

In	X
one	X
instance	X
,	X
the	X
lawmakers	X
spent	X
days	X
discussing	X
and	X
then	X
approving	X
a	X
bill	X
banning	X
elected	X
governors	X
,	X
who	X
head	X
the	X
country	X
's	X
47	X
counties	X
,	X
from	X
being	X
referred	X
to	X
as	X
"	X
excellency	X
"	X
.	X

Yet	X
these	X
honourable	X
members	X
saw	X
nothing	X
dishonourable	X
about	X
exchanging	X
blows	X
live	X
on	X
TV	X
in	X
parliament	X
,	X
nor	X
fuelling	X
violence	X
during	X
their	X
various	X
party	X
elections	X
.	X

While	X
all	X
this	X
was	X
going	X
on	X
,	X
the	X
critical	X
issues	X
that	X
ordinary	X
citizens	X
were	X
focused	X
on	X
,	X
such	X
as	X
persistent	X
insecurity	X
and	X
the	X
current	X
drought	X
that	X
is	X
threatening	X
hundreds	X
of	X
thousands	X
of	X
people	X
,	X
remain	X
unaddressed	X
.	X

The	X
stations	X
that	X
staged	X
the	X
blackout	X
wanted	X
more	X
time	X
for	X
the	X
move	X
from	X
analogue	X
to	X
digital	X
transmission	X

It	X
is	X
known	X
all	X
over	X
the	X
world	X
that	X
politicians	X
need	X
the	X
oxygen	X
of	X
publicity	X
to	X
survive	X
.	X

And	X
so	X
the	X
Kenyan	X
species	X
refused	X
to	X
go	X
away	X
quietly	X
.	X

Many	X
politicians	X
criticised	X
the	X
government	X
for	X
failing	X
to	X
give	X
the	X
TV	X
stations	X
adequate	X
time	X
to	X
prepare	X
for	X
the	X
move	X
to	X
digital	X
transmission	X
.	X

"	X
This	X
is	X
a	X
grave	X
matter	X
of	X
this	X
nation	X
,"	X
one	X
opposition	X
MP	X
said	X
.	X

"	X
We	X
should	X
not	X
be	X
taken	X
back	X
to	X
pre-1990	X
where	X
Kenyans	X
were	X
forced	X
to	X
watch	X
(	X
the	X
state-owned	X
)	X
KBC	X
.	X
"	X

Some	X
of	X
the	X
politicians	X
went	X
as	X
far	X
as	X
urging	X
Kenyans	X
to	X
stage	X
street	X
protests	X
demanding	X
the	X
resumption	X
of	X
TV	X
broadcasts	X
.	X

But	X
their	X
pleas	X
failed	X
to	X
persuade	X
the	X
Communications	X
Authority	X
of	X
Kenya	X
to	X
change	X
its	X
mind	X
and	X
reconcile	X
with	X
the	X
TV	X
stations	X
.	X

And	X
so	X
for	X
three	X
weeks	X
,	X
Kenyans	X
got	X
away	X
from	X
their	X
politicians	X
,	X
who	X
were	X
restricted	X
to	X
radio	X
and	X
newspapers	X
where	X
they	X
seemed	X
less	X
overbearing	X
and	X
tiresome	X
.	X

Joseph	X
Warungu	X
:	X

"	X

you	X
are	X
vaguely	X

stuck	X
together	X

But	X
politicians	X
have	X
creative	X
moves	X
for	X
survival	X
and	X
this	X
peace	X
and	X
quiet	X
did	X
not	X
last	X
long	X
.	X

When	X
the	X
television	X
stations	X
went	X
off	X
the	X
air	X
,	X
they	X
took	X
over	X
dead	X

If	X
you	X
are	X

and	X
happen	X
to	X

rest	X
assured	X
that	X
your	X
funeral	X
will	X
be	X
turned	X
into	X
a	X
shameless	X
political	X
arena	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
common	X
practice	X
for	X
politicians	X
to	X
turn	X
up	X
at	X
funerals	X
and	X
then	X
queue	X
up	X
to	X
give	X
long	X
speeches	X
that	X
neither	X
eulogise	X
the	X
dead	X
nor	X
console	X
the	X
bereaved	X
,	X
but	X
instead	X
promote	X
their	X
agenda	X
and	X
attack	X
opponents	X
.	X

So	X
prevalent	X
and	X
insensitive	X
is	X
the	X
practice	X
that	X
one	X
former	X
MP	X
,	X
Kuria	X
Kanyingi	X
,	X
took	X
the	X
precaution	X
of	X
banning	X
political	X
speeches	X
at	X
his	X
funeral	X
.	X

Mr	X
Kanyingi	X
,	X
who	X
before	X
he	X
died	X
late	X
last	X
year	X
was	X
a	X
highly	X
active	X
fundraiser	X
for	X
the	X
former	X
ruling	X
party	X
Kanu	X
,	X
had	X
left	X
very	X
clear	X
instructions	X
that	X
upon	X
his	X
death	X
no	X
political	X
oratory	X
should	X
be	X
allowed	X
during	X
his	X
burial	X
.	X

'	X
Out	X
of	X
tune	X
'	X

But	X
if	X
the	X
dead	X
will	X
not	X
play	X
ball	X
,	X
the	X
politician	X
can	X
always	X
turn	X
to	X
the	X
living	X
for	X
publicity	X
.	X

Kenya	X
has	X
a	X
vibrant	X
media	X
scene	X
and	X
television	X
is	X
the	X
main	X
news	X
source	X
in	X
cities	X
and	X
towns	X

Some	X
are	X
now	X
very	X
quick	X
to	X
invite	X
successful	X
Kenyan	X
musicians	X
to	X
attend	X
their	X
birthday	X
parties	X
or	X
other	X
events	X
,	X
hoping	X
that	X
the	X
brand	X
association	X
will	X
earn	X
political	X
mileage	X
.	X

And	X
when	X
this	X
does	X
not	X
work	X
,	X
the	X
politicians	X
have	X
no	X
qualms	X
about	X
singing	X
in	X
public	X
,	X
out	X
of	X
tune	X
and	X
out	X

A	X
number	X
of	X
politicians	X
own	X
radio	X
stations	X
in	X
Kenya	X
,	X
and	X
so	X
if	X
everything	X
else	X
fails	X

they	X
can	X
always	X
rely	X
on	X

Part	X
of	X
the	X
reason	X
for	X
these	X

Mr	X

there	X
is	X
an	X
unclear	X
regulatory	X
landscape	X
and	X
financial	X
institutions	X
are	X
very	X
risk	X
averse	X
when	X
it	X
comes	X
to	X

operations	X

more	X

Another	X
concern	X

that	X
the	X
volatility	X

But	X
the	X
remittance	X
companies	X
say	X
this	X
risk	X
is	X
removed	X
by	X
the	X
fact	X
they	X
immediately	X
convert	X
transfers	X
into	X
the	X
currency	X

this	X
is	X
an	X
agent	X
in	X
Addis	X

in	X
Ethiopia	X
-	X
but	X
the	X
fees	X
to	X
send	X
money	X
can	X
be	X
high	X

"	X
There	X
is	X
no	X
price	X

John	X

announced	X

after	X
finding	X
that	X
its	X
current	X
free	X
model	X
was	X
unsustainable	X

Click-and-collect	X
demand	X
has	X
boomed	X
for	X
the	X
department	X

It	X
now	X
processes	X
more	X
than	X
six	X
million	X
click-and-collect	X
orders	X
per	X
year	X
,	X
compared	X
with	X
just	X
350,000	X

and	X
moves	X
tens	X

A	X
spokeswoman	X
said	X
John	X

had	X
seen	X
a	X
32	X
%	X
growth	X
in	X
demand	X
for	X
the	X
service	X
so	X
far	X
this	X
year	X
.	X

And	X
the	X
seemingly	X
effortless	X
method	X
of	X
shopping	X
is	X
anything	X
but	X
for	X
retailers	X
as	X
it	X
needs	X
an	X
army	X
of	X
behind-the-scenes	X
pickers	X
and	X
delivery	X
staff	X

John	X
Lewis	X
is	X
having	X
to	X
move	X
fast	X
to	X
cope	X
with	X
demand	X

But	X
it	X
is	X
not	X
alone	X

according	X
to	X
Andy	X

It	X
estimates	X

growth	X
rate	X
in	X
click-and-collect	X
across	X
all	X

that	X
sell	X
online	X

have	X

click-and-collect	X
accounted	X
for	X
4	X
%	X

online	X
sales	X
in	X
2010	X

That	X
figure	X
jumped	X
to	X
17.7	X
%	X
in	X
2014	X

he	X
adds	X
.	X

John	X
Lewis	X
is	X
in	X
a	X
position	X
of	X
strength	X
,	X
but	X
this	X
growth	X
is	X
causing	X
significant	X
problems	X
for	X
some	X
retailers	X
-	X
especially	X
UK	X
supermarket	X
giants	X
,	X
according	X
to	X
some	X
retail	X
analysts	X

The	X
phenomenon	X
is	X
adding	X
to	X
supermarkets'	X
woes	X
,	X
rather	X
than	X
easing	X
them	X

'	X

Free	X

"	X
clearly	X
a	X
burden	X
on	X
supermarkets'	X
already	X
slim	X
margins	X

as	X
it	X
does	X
not	X
bring	X
in	X
nearly	X
enough	X

to	X
cover	X
the	X
extra	X
costs	X
involved	X

Mr	X

Speville	X
says	X

Even	X
Tesco	X
,	X
which	X
charges	X
Â£	X
4	X
for	X
click-and-collect	X
orders	X
below	X
Â£	X

still	X
has	X
to	X
heavily	X
subsidise	X

he	X

"	X
All	X
the	X
major	X
brick-and-mortar	X
supermarket	X
groups	X
face	X
the	X
same	X
problem	X
:	X
whether	X
orders	X
are	X
picked	X
up	X
in	X
store	X
or	X
delivered	X
to	X
the	X
home	X

online	X
adds	X
considerable	X
cost	X

complexity	X

but	X
very	X
little	X
in	X
the	X
way	X
of	X
additional	X
sales	X
,"	X
he	X
adds	X
.	X

Supermarkets	X
face	X
many	X
pressures	X
on	X
their	X
profits	X
,	X
including	X
a	X
bitter	X
price	X
war	X
,	X
and	X
having	X
to	X
try	X
to	X
regain	X
market	X
share	X
from	X
discounters	X
.	X

But	X
the	X
more	X
the	X
online	X
market	X
grows	X
,	X
the	X
more	X
margins	X
will	X
be	X
diluted	X
,	X
he	X
says	X
.	X

And	X
what	X
's	X
more	X
,	X
there	X
are	X
"	X
dis-economies	X
"	X
of	X
scale	X
,	X
he	X
adds	X

Once	X
online	X
sales	X
account	X
for	X
around	X
10	X
%	X
of	X
a	X
store	X
's	X
sales	X

picking	X

to	X
be	X
moved	X
out	X
to	X
dedicated	X
warehouses	X
or	X
"	X
dark	X
"	X
stores	X
.	X

This	X
can	X
duplicate	X
running	X
costs	X
and	X
means	X
customers	X
are	X
less	X
likely	X
to	X
visit	X
physical	X
stores	X

making	X
them	X
more	X
of	X
a	X
drag	X
on	X

Mr	X

Speville	X
says	X

"	X
I	X
see	X
this	X
'	X

conundrum	X
'	X
as	X
an	X
even	X
greater	X
long-term	X
threat	X

the	X

he	X
adds	X

Supermarkets	X
also	X
face	X
a	X
much	X
bigger	X
challenge	X
than	X
other	X
retailers	X
,	X
Mr	X
de	X
Speville	X
says	X
.	X

Grocery	X
orders	X
are	X
much	X
more	X
time-consuming	X
and	X
costly	X
for	X
the	X
retailer	X
to	X
fulfil	X
than	X
general	X
merchandise	X
.	X

Online	X
sales	X
can	X
mean	X
picking	X
of	X
products	X
has	X
to	X
be	X
moved	X
out	X
to	X

Sorcerers	X
or	X
apprentices	X
?	X

So	X
far	X
,	X
retailers	X
have	X
been	X
split	X
into	X
those	X
who	X
have	X
made	X
click-and-collect	X
work	X
,	X
and	X
those	X
who	X
have	X
n't	X
.	X

And	X
so	X
far	X
,	X
supermarkets	X
have	X
been	X
firmly	X
on	X
the	X
losing	X
side	X
,	X
says	X
Phil	X
Dorrell	X
of	X
Retail	X

"	X
Any	X

costs	X
more	X

he	X
says	X
"	X
If	X
(	X

Mr	X

click-and-collect	X

at	X

is	X
"	X
not	X
fussed	X
about	X
click-and-collect	X

and	X
has	X
concentrated	X
on	X
improving	X
its	X

it	X

that	X
is	X
being	X
trialled	X

The	X
common	X
characteristic	X
of	X
the	X
success	X
of	X
both	X
retailers	X
is	X
strong	X
leadership	X

which	X
is	X
even	X
more	X

school	X
of	X
philosophy	X
,	X
may	X
hold	X
some	X
answers	X
,	X
writes	X
professor	X
William	X
Irvine	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
the	X
Greeks	X
who	X
gave	X
us	X
the	X
word	X
"	X
crisis	X
"	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
derived	X
from	X
the	X
Greek	X
krinein	X
,	X
meaning	X
"	X
decide	X
"	X
,	X
and	X
indeed	X
,	X
the	X
Greek	X
government	X
now	X
has	X
lots	X
of	X
important	X
decisions	X
to	X
make	X
,	X
as	X
the	X
result	X
of	X
years	X
of	X
reckless	X
borrowing	X
from	X
overly-eager	X
lenders	X
.	X

Its	X
citizens	X
also	X
have	X
some	X
important	X
decisions	X
to	X
make	X
,	X
including	X
how	X
best	X
to	X
deal	X
with	X
the	X
lean	X
times	X
that	X
likely	X
lie	X
ahead	X
.	X

Fortunately	X
for	X
them	X
,	X
the	X
ancient	X
Greeks	X
,	X
besides	X
giving	X
us	X
our	X
word	X
for	X
crisis	X
,	X
provided	X
us	X
with	X
a	X
splendid	X
strategy	X
for	X
dealing	X
with	X
crises	X
:	X
the	X
philosophy	X
known	X
as	X
Stoicism	X
.	X

Contrary	X
to	X
popular	X
belief	X
,	X
Stoicism	X
does	X
not	X
advocate	X
that	X
we	X
keep	X
a	X
stiff	X
upper	X
lip	X
-	X
that	X
we	X
stand	X
there	X
mutely	X
and	X
impassively	X
,	X
and	X
take	X
whatever	X
the	X
world	X
throws	X
at	X
us	X
.	X

It	X
instead	X
provides	X
us	X
with	X
a	X
number	X
of	X
specific	X
strategies	X
which	X
,	X
if	X
practised	X
,	X
can	X
make	X
our	X
days	X
go	X
better	X
,	X
in	X
both	X
good	X
times	X
and	X
bad	X
.	X

One	X
component	X
of	X
the	X
Stoic	X
strategy	X
is	X
to	X
distinguish	X
between	X
things	X
we	X
can	X
control	X
and	X
things	X
we	X
ca	X
n't	X
.	X

Our	X
life	X
,	X
say	X
the	X
Stoics	X
,	X
will	X
be	X
miserable	X
if	X
we	X
spend	X
our	X
time	X
worrying	X
about	X
things	X
over	X
which	X
we	X
have	X
no	X
control	X
.	X

That	X
time	X
and	X
energy	X
is	X
far	X
better	X
spent	X
thinking	X
about	X
things	X
we	X
can	X
affect	X
.	X

To	X
quote	X
Roman	X
Stoic	X
Marcus	X
Aurelius	X
,	X
"	X
Nothing	X
is	X
worth	X
doing	X
pointlessly	X
.	X
"	X

One	X
of	X
the	X
things	X
we	X
have	X
no	X
control	X
over	X
is	X
the	X
past	X
.	X

We	X
cannot	X
alter	X
it	X
.	X

We	X
therefore	X
need	X
to	X
decide	X
whether	X
we	X
are	X
going	X
to	X
spend	X
our	X
life	X
filled	X
with	X
regret	X
over	X
choices	X
we	X
have	X
made	X
in	X
the	X
past	X
,	X
or	X
whether	X
we	X
are	X
going	X
to	X
let	X
go	X
of	X
that	X
past	X
and	X
instead	X
focus	X
our	X
attention	X
on	X
the	X
choices	X
that	X
lie	X
ahead	X
.	X

It	X
ought	X
to	X
be	X
an	X
easy	X
decision	X
to	X
make	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
also	X
a	X
decision	X
that	X
many	X
people	X
,	X
tragically	X
,	X
fail	X
to	X
make	X
.	X

The	X
Stoics	X
have	X
a	X
simple	X
technique	X
for	X
making	X
our	X
days	X
go	X
better	X
:	X
we	X
should	X
think	X
about	X
how	X
they	X
could	X
have	X
been	X
worse	X
.	X

Notice	X
that	X
I	X
did	X
n't	X
say	X
dwell	X
on	X
how	X
they	X
could	X
have	X
been	X
worse	X
;	X
that	X
would	X
be	X
a	X
recipe	X
for	X
a	X
miserable	X
existence	X
.	X

Instead	X
,	X
we	X
should	X
allow	X
ourselves	X
to	X
entertain	X
flickering	X
thoughts	X
about	X
the	X
loss	X
of	X
our	X
friends	X
,	X
money	X
,	X
lover	X
,	X
job	X
,	X
health	X
-	X
all	X
the	X
things	X
we	X
value	X
.	X

If	X
we	X
do	X
lose	X
any	X
of	X
these	X
things	X
,	X
we	X
will	X
have	X
been	X
prepared	X
by	X
our	X
negative	X
thinking	X
,	X
and	X
this	X
will	X
likely	X
lessen	X
the	X
blow	X
of	X
our	X
loss	X
;	X
we	X
will	X
,	X
in	X
a	X
sense	X
,	X
have	X
seen	X
it	X
coming	X
.	X

And	X
if	X
we	X
do	X
n't	X
lose	X
these	X
things	X
,	X
we	X
will	X
find	X
ourselves	X
far	X
more	X
appreciative	X
of	X
them	X
than	X
would	X
otherwise	X
have	X
been	X
the	X
case	X
.	X

A	X
life	X
filled	X
with	X
people	X
and	X
things	X
that	X
we	X
appreciate	X
is	X
easy	X
to	X
enjoy	X
.	X

The	X
Stoics	X
were	X
smart	X
enough	X
to	X
realise	X
that	X
we	X
have	X
it	X
in	X
our	X
power	X
to	X
appreciate	X
the	X
life	X
we	X
find	X
ourselves	X
living	X
if	X
we	X
can	X
just	X
bear	X
in	X
mind	X
that	X
things	X
are	X
a	X
lot	X
better	X
than	X
they	X
could	X
have	X
been	X
.	X

The	X
Stoics	X
valued	X
self-control	X
,	X
as	X
did	X
most	X
ancient	X
philosophers	X
.	X

If	X
we	X
have	X
self-control	X
,	X
we	X
control	X
ourselves	X
;	X
lack	X
it	X
,	X
and	X
it	X
is	X
someone	X
or	X
something	X
else	X
that	X
controls	X
us	X
.	X

Do	X
we	X
really	X
want	X
to	X
spend	X
the	X
one	X
life	X
we	X
have	X
controlled	X
by	X
someone	X
or	X
something	X
else	X
?	X

The	X
current	X
Greek	X
crisis	X
can	X
be	X
attributed	X
to	X
a	X
lack	X
of	X
self-control	X
:	X
the	X
Greek	X
government	X
borrowed	X
more	X
money	X
than	X
it	X
could	X
comfortably	X
pay	X
back	X
.	X

Borrowing	X
money	X
,	X
unfortunately	X
,	X
is	X
like	X
using	X
drugs	X
:	X
it	X
feels	X
good	X
at	X
first	X
and	X
feels	X
bad	X
later	X
on	X
.	X

This	X
makes	X
it	X
easy	X
for	X
borrowers	X
to	X
focus	X
their	X
attention	X
on	X
the	X
pleasant	X
present	X
and	X
put	X
off	X
thoughts	X
about	X
a	X
future	X
in	X
which	X
the	X
only	X
choices	X
open	X
to	X
them	X
are	X
painful	X
.	X

The	X
Stoics	X
thought	X
people	X
could	X
develop	X
self-control	X
by	X
engaging	X
in	X
acts	X
of	X
self-denial	X
.	X

They	X
did	X
n't	X
advocate	X
anything	X
extreme	X
:	X
it	X
was	X
their	X
philosophical	X
rivals	X
the	X
Cynics	X
who	X
suggested	X
doing	X
such	X
things	X
as	X
hugging	X
statues	X
on	X
cold	X
winter	X
days	X
.	X

The	X
Stoics	X
instead	X
advocate	X
that	X
we	X
periodically	X
go	X
out	X
of	X
our	X
way	X
to	X
make	X
ourselves	X
somewhat	X
uncomfortable	X
.	X

Fail	X
to	X
do	X
this	X
,	X
and	X
we	X
will	X
lose	X
our	X
tolerance	X
for	X
discomfort	X
,	X
meaning	X
that	X
the	X
slightest	X
inconvenience	X
will	X
have	X
the	X
power	X
to	X
ruin	X
our	X
day	X
.	X

Those	X
inured	X
to	X
discomfort	X
,	X
the	X
Stoics	X
realised	X
,	X
are	X
almost	X
always	X
happier	X
than	X
those	X
who	X
lead	X
a	X
pampered	X
existence	X
.	X

Star	X
Trek	X
creator	X
Gene	X
Roddenberry	X
said	X
he	X
thought	X
of	X
Spock	X
as	X
a	X
Stoic	X
,	X
but	X
Stoics	X
are	X
not	X
unemotional	X
-	X
they	X
cultivate	X
positive	X
emotions	X
and	X
avoid	X
negative	X
ones	X

The	X
current	X
Greek	X
crisis	X
will	X
doubtless	X
cause	X
people	X
much	X
discomfort	X
.	X

Many	X
Greeks	X
will	X
respond	X
,	X
as	X
people	X
often	X
do	X
,	X
by	X
bemoaning	X
their	X
fate	X
.	X

The	X
Stoics	X
among	X
them	X
,	X
though	X
,	X
will	X
treat	X
a	X
time	X
of	X
economic	X
austerity	X
as	X
a	X
kind	X
of	X
test	X
.	X

When	X
life	X
throws	X
an	X
obstacle	X
in	X
their	X
way	X
,	X
Stoics	X
do	X
their	X
best	X
to	X
take	X
it	X
in	X
their	X
stride	X
or	X
even	X
to	X
profit	X
from	X
it	X

Zeno	X
of	X
Citium	X
was	X
a	X
merchant	X
who	X
found	X
himself	X
in	X
Athens	X
as	X
the	X
result	X
of	X
a	X
shipwreck	X
.	X

While	X
there	X
,	X
he	X
took	X
an	X
interest	X
in	X
philosophy	X
and	X
ended	X
up	X
founding	X
his	X
own	X
school	X
,	X
which	X
became	X
known	X
as	X
the	X
Stoics	X
because	X
he	X
gave	X
his	X
lectures	X
at	X
the	X
Stoa	X
Poikile	X
,	X
a	X
colonnade	X
in	X
the	X

of	X

Regarding	X
this	X
turn	X

Zeno	X
subsequently	X
commented	X
that	X

Roman	X
philosopher	X
Musonius	X
Rufus	X
is	X
another	X
example	X
of	X
a	X
Stoic	X
who	X
profited	X
from	X
what	X
others	X
would	X
take	X
to	X
be	X
misfortune	X
.	X

This	X
occurred	X
after	X
he	X
somehow	X
managed	X
to	X
annoy	X
Emperor	X
Nero	X
(	X
Tacitus	X
says	X
it	X
was	X
because	X
Nero	X
envied	X
his	X
fame	X
as	X
a	X
philosopher	X
)	X
and	X
was	X
banished	X
to	X
the	X
Greek	X
island	X
of	X
Gyaros	X
,	X
in	X
the	X
Aegean	X
Sea	X

The	X
island	X
was	X
desolate	X
,	X
bleak	X

and	X
nearly	X
waterless	X

to	X

even	X

Post-Soviet	X

Following	X
the	X
collapse	X
of	X
communism	X
in	X
the	X
USSR	X
in	X
1991	X
,	X
Georgians	X
voted	X
overwhelmingly	X
for	X
the	X
restoration	X
of	X
independence	X
and	X
elected	X
nationalist	X
leader	X
Zviad	X
Gamsakhurdia	X
as	X
president	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
Gamsakhurdia	X
was	X
soon	X
overthrown	X
by	X
opposition	X
militias	X
which	X
in	X

Soviet	X
Foreign	X
Minister	X
Eduard	X
Shevardnadze	X
as	X
the	X
country	X
's	X
new	X
leader	X
.	X

During	X
his	X
11	X
years	X
in	X
office	X
,	X
the	X
Georgian	X
people	X
felt	X
increasingly	X
at	X
the	X
mercy	X
of	X
poverty	X
,	X
corruption	X
and	X
crime	X
.	X

He	X
was	X

mass	X

Once	X
a	X
relatively	X
affluent	X
part	X
of	X
the	X
USSR	X
,	X
with	X
independence	X
Georgia	X
lost	X
the	X
cheap	X
energy	X
to	X
which	X
it	X
had	X
access	X
in	X
the	X
Soviet	X
period	X
.	X

As	X
relations	X
between	X
Georgia	X
and	X
Russia	X
deteriorated	X
,	X
Moscow	X
did	X
not	X
flinch	X
from	X
tightening	X
the	X
economic	X
screws	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
rupturing	X
of	X
trading	X
ties	X
caused	X
the	X
Georgian	X
economy	X
to	X
nose-dive	X
.	X

Georgia	X
was	X
initially	X
heavily	X
dependent	X
on	X
Russia	X
for	X
its	X
energy	X
supply	X
.	X

Like	X
other	X
Soviet	X
states	X

it	X
was	X
badly	X

when	X
the	X
price	X

the	X
Russian	X
gas	X
giant	X
Gazprom	X
rose	X
sharply	X
in	X
2006	X

it	X
has	X
succeeded	X
in	X
diversifying	X
the	X
sources	X
of	X

Breakaway	X

Since	X

periods	X

the	X
breakaway	X

since	X
the	X
early	X

in	X
2008	X
Moscow	X
formally	X
recognised	X

to	X
be	X
descended	X
from	X

migrated	X
into	X
the	X
area	X
from	X
Asia	X
many	X
hundreds	X

and	X
settled	X
in	X
what	X
is	X
now	X
North	X
Ossetia	X

As	X
the	X
Russian	X
empire	X
expanded	X
into	X
the	X
area	X
in	X
the	X
18th	X
and	X
19th	X
centuries	X
,	X
the	X

putting	X
up	X
fierce	X
resistance	X

By	X
tradition	X

the	X
Ossetians	X
have	X
had	X
good	X
relations	X
with	X

and	X
were	X
regarded	X
as	X

of	X
the	X

empire	X
and	X
later	X
of	X

he	X
's	X
lived	X
in	X
Denmark	X
since	X
he	X
was	X
six	X

Ahmed	X
then	X
tells	X
his	X
story	X
,	X
describing	X
an	X
unexceptional	X
childhood	X
-	X
he	X
was	X
a	X
"	X
normal	X
kid	X

growing	X
up	X
in	X

learning	X
Danish	X
fast	X
.	X

"	X
Everything	X
was	X
good	X
for	X
me	X
at	X
that	X
time	X
,"	X
he	X
says	X
.	X

Then	X
,	X
when	X
he	X
was	X
in	X
his	X
teens	X
,	X
his	X
father	X
announced	X
that	X
he	X
was	X
taking	X
him	X
on	X
the	X
Hajj	X
,	X
the	X
pilgrimage	X
to	X
Mecca	X
.	X

They	X
call	X
me	X
a	X
terrorist	X
?	X

I	X
will	X
give	X
them	X
a	X
terrorist	X
if	X
they	X
want	X
that	X

"	X
It	X
was	X
important	X
for	X
my	X
father	X
to	X
get	X
me	X
more	X
religious	X
,"	X
he	X
says	X
.	X

"	X
I	X
did	X
n't	X
know	X
much	X
about	X
my	X
religion	X

It	X
was	X
like	X
I	X
had	X
left	X
it	X
in	X
Somalia	X

But	X
my	X
father	X
said	X
,	X
you	X
are	X
a	X
Muslim	X

have	X
a	X
Muslim	X
name	X

So	X
the	X
family	X
went	X
to	X
Mecca	X
and	X
Ahmed	X
remembered	X
returning	X
to	X
Denmark	X
with	X
a	X
sense	X
of	X
relief	X
.	X

"	X
When	X
we	X
came	X
back	X

was	X
happy	X

was	X

saw	X
the	X

saw	X

him	X
into	X
trouble	X

abandoned	X
jeans	X
and	X
T-shirts	X

took	X
to	X
wearing	X
traditional	X

He	X
became	X
defensive	X
and	X
argumentative	X
when	X
the	X
subject	X
of	X
religion	X
came	X
up	X

He	X
acknowledges	X
today	X
that	X

could	X
have	X
handled	X
things	X
better	X

but	X
at	X
the	X
time	X

he	X
said	X

responded	X
aggressively	X
because	X

felt	X

had	X
a	X
duty	X
to	X
defend	X
his	X

on	X

were	X
looking	X

him	X

"	X
When	X
I	X
got	X
home	X
,	X
he	X
was	X
shocked	X
and	X
angry	X

He	X
told	X
me	X
that	X
I	X
had	X
to	X
go	X
straight	X
to	X
the	X
police	X
station	X
the	X

ask	X
them	X
what	X
they	X
wanted	X

"	X

So	X
Ahmed	X
went	X
to	X
see	X
the	X
police	X
and	X
was	X
amazed	X
to	X
discover	X
that	X
he	X
'd	X

turned	X

the	X
principal	X
of	X

"	X
The	X
reason	X
you	X
are	X
here	X
,"	X
he	X
was	X
told	X
,	X
"	X
is	X
that	X
your	X

are	X
afraid	X

think	X
you	X

Ahmed	X
grins	X
as	X
he	X
remembers	X
all	X
this	X
.	X

But	X
it	X
was	X
n't	X
funny	X
at	X
the	X
time	X
-	X
he	X
had	X
a	X
vision	X
of	X
being	X
put	X
on	X
the	X
next	X
flight	X
to	X
Guantanamo	X
.	X

"	X
I	X
was	X
shocked	X
,"	X
he	X
says	X
"	X
and	X
I	X
had	X
no	X
words	X
to	X
defend	X
myself	X
.	X
"	X

The	X
police	X
then	X
told	X
him	X
they	X
would	X
need	X
to	X
search	X
his	X
home	X
and	X
that	X
they	X
would	X
need	X
the	X
password	X
to	X
his	X
email	X
account	X
and	X
any	X
other	X
social	X
media	X
that	X
he	X
used	X
.	X

"	X
I	X
gave	X
them	X
everything	X
and	X
they	X
searched	X
my	X
house	X
and	X
it	X
was	X
very	X
humiliating	X
to	X
watch	X
.	X

When	X
they	X
left	X
I	X
was	X
shocked	X
and	X
I	X
was	X
angry	X
,"	X
he	X
says	X
.	X

It	X
got	X
worse	X
.	X

All	X
this	X
had	X
happened	X
during	X
the	X
last	X
week	X
of	X
school	X
,	X
and	X
he	X
had	X
missed	X
the	X
end	X
of	X
year	X
exams	X
.	X

The	X
school	X
,	X
he	X
told	X
me	X
,	X
refused	X
to	X
allow	X
him	X
to	X
sit	X
them	X
late	X
.	X

"	X
That	X
gave	X
me	X
a	X
punch	X
in	X
the	X
face	X
,	X
and	X
gave	X
me	X
the	X
feeling	X
this	X
society	X
is	X
total	X
racist	X
,"	X
he	X
says	X
.	X

"	X
They	X
call	X
me	X
a	X
terrorist	X
?	X

I	X
will	X
give	X
them	X
a	X
terrorist	X
if	X
they	X
want	X
that	X
.	X
"	X

Ahmed	X
smiles	X
again	X
as	X
he	X
recounts	X
the	X
story	X
.	X

It	X
sounds	X
foolish	X
all	X
these	X
years	X
later	X
.	X

Ahmed	X
then	X
told	X
everything	X
to	X
his	X
friends	X
at	X
the	X
mosque	X
.	X

They	X
were	X
sympathetic	X
,	X
he	X
says	X
,	X
and	X
invited	X
him	X
home	X
.	X

There	X
were	X
long	X
discussions	X
about	X
the	X
hypocrisy	X
of	X
the	X
West	X
in	X
its	X
dealings	X
with	X
Muslims	X
and	X
Muslim	X
countries	X
.	X

They	X
watched	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
jihadi	X
videos	X
online	X
.	X

Ahmed	X
remembers	X
in	X
particular	X
those	X
that	X
featured	X
Anwar	X
al-Awlaki	X
,	X
the	X
radical	X
American	X
cleric	X
of	X
Yemeni	X
descent	X
,	X
who	X
was	X
killed	X
in	X
a	X
drone	X
strike	X
in	X
2011	X
.	X

"	X
He	X
would	X
say	X
things	X
like	X
,	X
'	X
We	X
are	X
at	X
war	X
with	X
the	X
West	X
,	X
the	X
West	X
will	X
kill	X
all	X
the	X
Muslims	X
around	X
the	X
world	X
if	X
we	X
do	X
n't	X
stand	X
up	X
to	X
them	X

and	X
I	X
was	X
like	X
,	X
OK	X
,	X
and	X
my	X
friends	X
were	X
saying	X
,	X
'	X
Yeah	X

he	X
's	X
totally	X
right	X

Finally	X
someone	X
drew	X
Ahmed	X
aside	X
and	X
suggested	X
that	X
if	X
he	X
wanted	X
to	X
learn	X
more	X
about	X

Ahmed	X
says	X
he	X
told	X
his	X
father	X
what	X
he	X
was	X
planning	X
.	X

His	X
father	X
said	X
he	X
would	X
n't	X
try	X
to	X
stop	X
him	X
but	X
advised	X
him	X
to	X
finish	X
high	X
school	X
first	X

Then	X
the	X
telephone	X
rang	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
the	X
police	X
and	X
they	X
wanted	X
to	X
invite	X
Ahmed	X
out	X
for	X
a	X
cup	X
of	X
coffee	X
.	X

He	X
went	X
,	X
reluctantly	X
.	X

"	X
Something	X
inside	X
me	X
said	X

are	X
never	X

why	X

n't	X
you	X
see	X
them	X
face-to-face	X

just	X
say	X
your	X
opinion	X

So	X
I	X
went	X
to	X
the	X
meeting	X
and	X
they	X
gave	X
me	X
some	X
coffee	X
and	X
we	X
talked	X

I	X
was	X
angry	X

I	X
said	X

But	X
the	X
police	X
had	X
an	X
offer	X
.	X

They	X
wanted	X
him	X
to	X
meet	X
someone	X
,	X
another	X
Muslim	X
,	X
they	X
said	X
,	X
who	X
could	X
talk	X

Ahmed	X
smiles	X
again	X

his	X
indignant	X
reaction	X

What	X

of	X
Muslim	X
could	X
this	X

Clearly	X
a	X
traitor	X

This	X
is	X
how	X

this	X

Ahmed	X
says	X
it	X
took	X
several	X
months	X
for	X
him	X
to	X
relax	X
.	X

In	X
the	X
beginning	X
he	X
would	X
frisk	X
Mahmoud	X
every	X
time	X
they	X
met	X

because	X
he	X
wanted	X
to	X
check	X
he	X
was	X
n't	X
wearing	X
a	X
microphone	X

He	X
says	X
their	X
arguments	X
were	X
intense	X
and	X
he	X
was	X
frustrated	X
that	X
Mahmoud	X
seemed	X
to	X
have	X
a	X
quiet	X
,	X
logical	X
answer	X
to	X
everything	X

Ahmed	X
says	X
he	X
asked	X
his	X

at	X
the	X
mosque	X
for	X
help	X

for	X
arguments	X
to	X
defeat	X
this	X

's	X
working	X

"	X
But	X
then	X
I	X
started	X
to	X
take	X
my	X
hands	X
down	X

boxing	X
you	X
have	X
your	X

"	X
And	X
he	X
discussed	X
with	X
me	X
in	X
a	X
logical	X
way	X

in	X
a	X
way	X
that	X
I	X
could	X

was	X

This	X
,	X
said	X
Ahmed	X
,	X
made	X
sense	X
to	X
him	X

was	X
n't	X
being	X
told	X
that	X
he	X
could	X
n't	X

day	X
after	X

a	X

version	X

the	X
proposal	X

left	X

with	X

there	X
are	X
reasons	X
for	X

would	X
not	X
manage	X
to	X
emulate	X

lacks	X

could	X
take	X
advantage	X
of	X

Furthermore	X

without	X

is	X
that	X

Security	X
analysts	X
in	X

out	X

seem	X
to	X
be	X
approaching	X
a	X
consensus	X
on	X
one	X
of	X
the	X
key	X
facets	X
of	X
the	X
conflict	X
in	X
the	X

:	X
and	X
that	X
is	X
that	X
the	X
Egyptian	X

is	X
treating	X
the	X
fight	X

traditional	X

combat	X

According	X

a	X
number	X
of	X
different	X

methods	X

tactics	X

the	X

that	X

experts	X

the	X
Egyptian	X

will	X
not	X
change	X
the	X
basic	X
structure	X

its	X
fighting	X
force	X

Yet	X
,	X
the	X
Egyptian	X

needs	X
a	X

among	X
the	X
local	X
population	X
towards	X
the	X
very	X
forces	X
fighting	X
the	X
insurgents	X
.	X

If	X
these	X
reports	X
are	X
accurate	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
effect	X
is	X
widespread	X
,	X
then	X
the	X
propensity	X
for	X
recruitment	X
increases	X
-	X
and	X
intelligence	X
gathering	X
against	X
the	X
militants	X
will	X
be	X
adversely	X
affected	X
.	X

Already	X
,	X
it	X
appears	X
to	X
be	X
the	X
case	X
that	X
Sinai	X
Province	X
members	X
know	X
the	X
peninsula	X
like	X
the	X
back	X
of	X
their	X
proverbial	X
hands	X
-	X
the	X
forces	X
combating	X
them	X
must	X
as	X
well	X
,	X
and	X
that	X
depends	X
on	X
good	X
relations	X
with	X
the	X
locals	X
.	X

Worse	X
still	X
,	X
if	X
bad	X
relations	X
are	X
the	X
consequence	X
of	X
current	X
tactics	X
,	X
then	X
the	X
Sinai	X
Province	X
group	X
's	X
shelf-live	X
is	X
dramatically	X
lengthened	X
.	X

Paying	X
the	X
price	X

If	X
the	X
Egyptian	X
authorities	X
are	X
to	X
successfully	X
address	X
the	X
threat	X
in	X
the	X
peninsula	X
,	X
there	X
are	X
two	X
things	X
that	X
need	X
to	X
be	X
done	X
.	X

The	X
first	X
is	X
to	X
ensure	X
that	X
all	X
tactics	X
on	X
the	X
peninsula	X
fit	X
a	X
broader	X
,	X
comprehensive	X
counter-terrorism	X
and	X
counter-insurgency	X
strategy	X
,	X
which	X
places	X
addressing	X
the	X
grievances	X
of	X
the	X
residents	X
at	X
its	X
heart	X
,	X
and	X
avoiding	X
exacerbating	X
them	X
.	X

The	X
existence	X
of	X
those	X
grievances	X
,	X
which	X
predate	X
the	X
conflict	X
by	X
some	X
time	X
,	X
relate	X
primarily	X
to	X
the	X
overwhelming	X
lack	X
of	X
development	X
in	X
the	X
Sinai	X
by	X
the	X
central	X
authorities	X
in	X
Cairo	X
,	X
cannot	X
be	X
ignored	X
.	X

Such	X
grievances	X
do	X
not	X
automatically	X
lead	X
to	X
successful	X
radical	X
recruitment	X
-	X
but	X
it	X
certainly	X
makes	X
the	X
job	X
of	X
the	X
recruiter	X
easier	X
.	X

Secondly	X
,	X
the	X
Egyptian	X
military	X
needs	X
to	X
focus	X
more	X
on	X
the	X
need	X
for	X
strategic	X
,	X
tactical	X
counter-terrorism	X
equipment	X
and	X
training	X
,	X
rather	X
than	X
the	X
more	X
regular	X
combat	X
strategies	X
that	X
it	X
has	X
been	X
relying	X
on	X
thus	X
far	X
.	X

If	X
the	X
last	X
few	X
days	X
have	X
shown	X
anything	X
,	X
it	X
is	X
that	X
the	X
current	X
strategy	X
is	X
not	X
succeeding	X
-	X
and	X
Egyptians	X
are	X
paying	X
the	X
price	X

I	X
was	X
a	X
rookie	X
again	X

I	X
got	X
a	X
call	X
on	X
the	X
radio	X
that	X
there	X
was	X
a	X
foot	X
chase	X
,	X
"	X
I	X
got	X
a	X
black	X
male	X
running	X
"	X
.	X

I	X
corner	X
him	X
in	X
an	X
alley	X
,	X
he	X
tried	X
to	X
get	X
away	X
,	X
there	X
is	X
a	X
little	X
bit	X
of	X
a	X
struggle	X
but	X
no	X
big	X
deal	X
.	X

I	X
handcuff	X
him	X
and	X
as	X
he	X
is	X
laying	X
on	X
the	X
ground	X
,	X
the	X
officer	X
that	X
was	X
chasing	X
him	X
comes	X
round	X
the	X
corner	X
.	X

And	X
with	X
a	X
steel-toed	X
boot	X
,	X
just	X
boom	X
right	X
in	X
the	X
face	X
.	X

His	X
eye	X
instantly	X
swells	X
up	X
and	X
he	X
is	X
hurt	X
pretty	X
good	X
.	X

This	X
was	X
cowardly	X
but	X
I	X
just	X
went	X
,	X
"	X
What	X
the	X
hell	X
dude	X
?	X
?	X

I	X
said	X
:	X
"	X
He	X
's	X
your	X
suspect	X
and	X
I	X
'm	X
out	X
of	X
here	X
.	X
"	X

Did	X
you	X
think	X
to	X
report	X
it	X
?	X

No	X
!	X

That	X
would	X
have	X
been	X
unheard	X
of	X
.	X

Anyone	X
who	X
runs	X
gets	X
beat	X
up	X

That	X
's	X
common	X
in	X
America	X

I	X
was	X
n't	X
putting	X
myself	X
in	X
the	X
victim	X
's	X
shoes	X

I	X
was	X
thinking	X
this	X
is	X
n't	X
me	X

This	X
guy	X
is	X
an	X
asshole	X

this	X

Defecating	X

In	X
around	X
2008	X

I	X
ended	X
up	X
being	X
assigned	X
to	X
a	X
plain	X

We	X
would	X
do	X
big	X
raids	X
around	X

would	X
frequently	X
do	X
big	X
raids	X
with	X
people	X
you	X
did	X
n't	X
know	X

So	X
we	X
were	X
in	X
a	X
raid	X
(	X
in	X
a	X
suspect	X
's	X
home	X
)	X
,	X
and	X
somebody	X
was	X
pissing	X
on	X
a	X
pillow	X
and	X
somebody	X
else	X
was	X
shitting	X
in	X
the	X
corner	X
-	X
and	X
it	X
was	X
just	X
like	X
,	X
what	X
the	X
hell	X
are	X
these	X
guys	X
doing	X
?	X

In	X
the	X
car	X
the	X
detectives	X
with	X
me	X
were	X
like	X
who	X
the	X
hell	X
does	X
this	X
?	X

Apparently	X
some	X
people	X
did	X
it	X
in	X
the	X
past	X
and	X
it	X
was	X
a	X
throwback	X
to	X
then	X
.	X

This	X
seems	X
very	X
brazen	X
-	X
you	X
would	X
be	X
leaving	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
forensic	X
evidence	X

Right	X

I	X
said	X
the	X

it	X
's	X
right	X
there	X

The	X

said	X
they	X
would	X
just	X
say	X
the	X
canine	X
did	X
it	X
-	X
it	X
's	X
not	X

There	X
are	X

there	X
are	X
a	X
bunch	X
of	X

they	X
jump	X
out	X

there	X

And	X
as	X
long	X
as	X
they	X
're	X

they	X
say	X

Legally	X

you	X
ca	X
n't	X
search	X
them	X

that	X
happens	X
to	X
everybody	X
.	X

You	X
just	X
grab	X
them	X
and	X
start	X
searching	X
them	X
.	X

I	X
did	X
it	X
,	X
we	X
all	X
do	X
it	X
-	X
it	X
's	X
what	X
police	X
do	X
.	X

Those	X
are	X
all	X
illegal	X
searches	X

How	X
frequently	X
did	X
you	X
do	X
it	X
?	X

I	X
was	X
standing	X
there	X
doing	X
it	X
with	X
everybody	X
else	X
.	X

That	X
's	X
just	X
what	X
you	X
're	X
taught	X
to	X
do	X

You	X
do	X
n't	X
even	X
think	X
-	X
it	X
's	X
what	X
you	X
do	X
.	X

'	X
This	X
is	X
Baltimore	X
-	X
you	X
target	X
black	X
males	X
!	X
!	X

This	X
was	X
a	X
realisation	X
that	X
I	X
did	X
n't	X
even	X
come	X
to	X
until	X
very	X
recently	X
.	X

So	X
I	X
ended	X
up	X
getting	X
my	X
bachelor	X
's	X
degree	X
when	X
I	X
was	X
in	X
the	X
police	X
department	X
.	X

I	X
started	X
reading	X
things	X
like	X
Freakonomics	X
-	X
things	X
that	X
teach	X
you	X
to	X
think	X
from	X
a	X
critical	X
perspective	X
.	X

I	X
was	X
a	X
shift	X
commander	X
,	X
and	X
I	X
told	X
the	X
shift	X
that	X
when	X
you	X
go	X
out	X
there	X
doing	X
car	X
stops	X
:	X

"	X
I	X
do	X
n't	X
want	X
to	X
see	X
you	X
stopping	X
an	X
old	X
lady	X
-	X
this	X
is	X
Baltimore	X
!	X

You	X
stop	X
16-24	X
year	X
old	X
black	X
males	X
.	X
"	X

Why	X
?	X

Because	X
16-24	X
black	X
males	X
are	X
the	X
ones	X
who	X
commit	X
all	X
the	X
crime	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
not	X
until	X
later	X
that	X
you	X
complete	X
the	X
logic	X
circle	X
and	X
realise	X
that	X
black	X
and	X
white	X
(	X
people	X
)	X
have	X
drug	X
possession	X
at	X
the	X
same	X
rate	X
.	X

You	X
are	X
only	X
locking	X
up	X
black	X
guys	X
because	X
they	X
have	X
drugs	X
on	X
them	X
,	X
and	X
then	X
they	X
get	X
in	X
more	X
trouble	X
.	X

We	X
did	X
n't	X
know	X
about	X
the	X
concept	X
of	X
institutional	X
racism	X
.	X

You	X
left	X
in	X
2014	X
-	X
is	X
that	X
common	X
?	X

Oh	X
it	X
will	X
continue	X
to	X
be	X
common	X
until	X
somebody	X
takes	X
over	X
an	X
agency	X
and	X
says	X
no	X
(	X
to	X
racial	X
profiling	X
)	X
.	X

If	X
the	X
officers	X
are	X
found	X
guilty	X
of	X
Freddie	X
Gray	X
's	X
murder	X
how	X
will	X
the	X
police	X
respond	X
?	X

I	X
do	X
n't	X
think	X
there	X
is	X
(	X
any	X
)	X
chance	X
that	X
they	X
will	X
be	X
happy	X
that	X
a	X
murderer	X
was	X
caught	X
.	X

That	X
seems	X
unfathomable	X
right	X
now	X
.	X

They	X
're	X
gonna	X
feel	X
like	X
their	X
people	X
got	X

're	X

Analysis	X

By	X
Iain	X
Watson	X
,	X
BBC	X
political	X
correspondent	X

Michael	X
Fallon	X
was	X
dipping	X
the	X
government	X
's	X
toe	X
in	X
the	X
Opposition	X
's	X
water	X
.	X

The	X
defence	X
secretary	X
has	X
long	X
believed	X
it	X
is	X
not	X
logical	X
to	X
limit	X
air	X
strikes	X
to	X
Iraq	X
when	X
the	X
terrorists	X
do	X
not	X
respect	X
,	X
or	X
even	X
recognise	X
,	X
borders	X
.	X

But	X
he	X
stressed	X
that	X
the	X
government	X
would	X
only	X
widen	X
the	X
RAF	X
's	X
operations	X
to	X
Syria	X
if	X
he	X
could	X
gain	X
"	X
some	X
consensus	X
"	X
in	X
Parliament	X
.	X

So	X
while	X
any	X
air	X
strikes	X
in	X
Syria	X
would	X
be	X
unlikely	X
to	X
go	X
ahead	X
until	X
a	X
new	X
Labour	X
leader	X
is	X
in	X
place	X
in	X
September	X
,	X
Mr	X
Fallon	X
would	X
be	X
encouraged	X
to	X
hear	X
acting	X
leader	X
Harriet	X
Harman	X
and	X
shadow	X
defence	X
secretary	X
Vernon	X
Coaker	X
say	X
they	X
would	X
consider	X
any	X
proposals	X
seriously	X
.	X

Their	X
support	X
is	X
important	X
,	X
because	X
David	X
Cameron	X
would	X
not	X
risk	X
going	X
down	X
to	X
defeat	X
as	X
he	X
did	X
over	X
the	X
separate	X
issue	X
of	X
air	X
strikes	X
against	X
the	X
Assad	X
regime	X
in	X
2013	X
.	X

But	X
there	X
were	X
other	X
signs	X
that	X
a	X
consensus	X
could	X
be	X
difficult	X
to	X
achieve	X
.	X

Some	X
Conservative	X
backbenchers	X
raised	X
doubts	X
about	X
further	X
military	X
action	X
in	X
the	X
absence	X
of	X

The	X
distinctiveness	X

the	X

raises	X
the	X
question	X
of	X
why	X
exactly	X

many	X

manufacturer	X
have	X
been	X
targeted	X
in	X
this	X

may	X

relevant	X
that	X
General	X

in	X
Luton	X

The	X

cost	X

Â£	X

The	X
value	X
of	X
those	X

far	X
runs	X
to	X
tens	X

for	X
a	X

all	X
four	X
majors	X

the	X
59th-ranked	X
Watson	X
--	X
roared	X
on	X
by	X
the	X
British	X
faithful	X
on	X
Center	X
Court	X
--	X
gave	X
Williams	X
her	X
toughest	X
match	X
this	X
summer	X

She	X
was	X
two	X
points	X
away	X
from	X
victory	X
deep	X
in	X
the	X
third	X
set	X
,	X
when	X

appeared	X
to	X
cry	X

since	X

world	X
No.	X
1	X
but	X
oh	X
,	X
how	X
Watson	X
indeed	X
came	X
close	X
.	X

Williams	X
must	X
have	X
flashed	X
back	X
to	X
Wimbledon	X
one	X
year	X
ago	X
,	X
when	X
she	X
was	X
ousted	X
in	X
the	X

round	X
by	X
a	X
similar	X
type	X
of	X
counter-puncher	X
,	X
Alize	X
Cornet	X

In	X
what	X
must	X
be	X
a	X
relief	X
for	X
Williams	X
,	X
she	X
has	X
two	X
days	X
to	X
recover	X
--	X
mentally	X
and	X
physically	X
--	X
before	X
meeting	X
older	X
sister	X
Venus	X
Williams	X
in	X
the	X
fourth	X
round	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
their	X
first	X
matchup	X
at	X
a	X
grand	X
slam	X
in	X
five	X
years	X
and	X
Serena	X
claimed	X
after	X
Friday	X
's	X
performance	X
that	X
her	X
sibling	X
held	X
the	X
edge	X
.	X

Venus	X
Williams	X
,	X
like	X
Serena	X
a	X
five-time	X
Wimbledon	X
champ	X
,	X
had	X
no	X
such	X
troubles	X
Friday	X
,	X
routing	X
Aleksandra	X
Krunic	X
6-3	X
6-2	X
.	X

In	X
an	X
absorbing	X
third	X
set	X
,	X
Watson	X
led	X
by	X
two	X
breaks	X
at	X
3-0	X
.	X

With	X
Watson	X
keeping	X
balls	X
in	X
play	X
and	X
making	X
Serena	X
Williams	X
hit	X
extra	X
shots	X
,	X
the	X
latter	X
duly	X
produced	X
unforced	X
errors	X
.	X

There	X
were	X
33	X
overall	X
,	X
a	X
telling	X
figure	X
on	X
grass	X
.	X

Watson	X
even	X
had	X
a	X
point	X
for	X
4-0	X
,	X
though	X
Serena	X
Williams	X
broke	X
for	X
3-1	X
.	X

And	X
when	X
Watson	X
relinquished	X
serve	X
from	X
40-0	X
to	X
make	X
the	X
score	X
3-3	X
,	X
many	X
must	X
have	X
thought	X
her	X
chance	X
was	X
gone	X
--	X
especially	X
as	X
she	X
then	X
trailed	X
4-3	X
.	X

But	X
Watson	X
claimed	X
the	X
ensuing	X
two	X
games	X
for	X
an	X
opportunity	X
to	X
serve	X
it	X
out	X
at	X
5-4	X
.	X

Watson	X
is	X
in	X
the	X
midst	X
of	X
revamping	X
her	X
game	X
,	X
wanting	X
to	X
be	X
more	X
aggressive	X
.	X

It	X
showed	X
when	X
she	X
saved	X
a	X
third	X
break	X
point	X
with	X
an	X
ace	X
.	X

Serena	X
Williams	X
,	X
however	X
,	X
is	X
difficult	X
to	X
put	X
away	X
and	X
got	X
her	X
reward	X
through	X
an	X
unforced	X
error	X
to	X
level	X
.	X

Serving	X
at	X
5-6	X
,	X
Watson	X
managed	X
to	X
fend	X
off	X
two	X
match	X
points	X
on	X
the	X
ad	X
side	X
as	X
Serena	X
Williams	X
struck	X
almost	X
two	X
identical	X
returns	X
into	X
the	X
net	X
.	X

Third	X
time	X
was	X
a	X
charm	X
for	X
Serena	X
Williams	X
when	X
she	X
powered	X
a	X
backhand	X
cross-court	X
that	X
forced	X
a	X
Watson	X
backhand	X
error	X
.	X

Serena	X
Williams	X
thought	X
her	X
ball	X
was	X
long	X
but	X
to	X
her	X
delight	X
,	X
Watson	X
's	X
challenge	X
showed	X
the	X
ball	X
to	X
be	X
in	X
.	X

Serena	X

down	X

'll	X
presumably	X
soon	X
turn	X

born	X
50	X
years	X

during	X
the	X

counter-culture	X
.	X

The	X
first	X
time	X
I	X
saw	X
the	X
Grateful	X
Dead	X
was	X
in	X
1992	X
,	X
the	X
summer	X
before	X
I	X
started	X
college	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
insane	X
for	X
me	X
to	X
see	X
Soldier	X
Field	X
,	X
the	X
place	X
I	X
grew	X
up	X
watching	X
so	X
many	X
Chicago	X
Bears	X
games	X
,	X
be	X
transformed	X
into	X
a	X
raging	X
party	X

"	X
Deadheads	X
"	X
of	X
all	X
ages	X
descended	X
on	X
my	X
hometown	X
to	X
dance	X

sing	X
,	X
and	X
celebrate	X
life	X
.	X

I	X
was	X
fascinated	X
with	X
how	X
a	X
weird	X
band	X
from	X
the	X
'	X
60s	X
could	X
connect	X
with	X
a	X
stadium	X
packed	X
with	X
so	X
many	X
different	X
types	X
of	X
people	X

became	X
hooked	X
during	X
the	X
whole	X
experience	X
of	X
going	X
to	X
my	X
first	X
show	X
.	X

But	X
when	X
the	X
party	X
was	X
over	X
and	X
I	X
started	X
exploring	X
the	X
band	X

catalog	X

records	X

became	X
obsessed	X

Here	X
are	X
a	X

a	X

of	X
their	X
great	X
songs	X

could	X
bust	X
out	X
on	X
any	X

night	X

As	X
a	X
young	X
producer	X
with	X
CNN	X
in	X
2002	X
,	X
I	X
jumped	X
at	X
the	X
chance	X
to	X
mix	X
in	X
a	X
little	X
fun	X
music	X
coverage	X
with	X
all	X
the	X
hard	X
news	X
stories	X
,	X
and	X
with	X
that	X
came	X
various	X
opportunities	X
of	X
a	X
lifetime	X
to	X
interview	X
the	X
four	X
men	X
who	X
founded	X
the	X

So	X
without	X
any	X
more	X
rambling	X

here	X
are	X
some	X
of	X
my	X
favorite	X
quotes	X

legacy	X

all	X

you	X

At	X
Natural	X
Bridges	X

I	X
camped	X
out	X
and	X
then	X
rode	X
my	X
bike	X
in	X
the	X

I	X
was	X

alone	X

At	X

four	X
other	X
people	X
were	X
already	X
crouched	X
on	X
the	X
sandy	X
ground	X
around	X
the	X
rock-paved	X
trail	X
,	X
shooting	X
time-lapses	X
and	X
long	X
exposures	X

We	X
discussed	X
our	X
equipment	X
in	X
whispers	X
that	X
echoed	X
loud	X
against	X
the	X
rock	X
walls	X
of	X
the	X
canyon	X

and	X
stumbled	X
our	X
way	X
around	X
by	X
the	X
light	X
of	X
red	X
headlamps	X

used	X
to	X
maintain	X
our	X
night	X

The	X

frequent	X

us	X
rarely	X

any	X

in	X

that	X
's	X

a	X

off	X

controlled	X
the	X

Today	X
,	X
a	X
small	X
chorus	X
of	X
voices	X
asks	X
that	X
we	X
reconsider	X
our	X
decision	X
to	X
down	X
out	X
the	X
night	X

On	X

trip	X

shoot	X

I	X
shot	X
in	X
both	X

at	X

n't	X
a	X
formally	X
recognized	X
dark	X

in	X
some	X
cases	X
it	X

literally	X
on	X

side	X
of	X
a	X

do	X
n't	X
get	X
too	X
close	X

because	X
even	X
the	X

in	X
your	X

could	X
mar	X
the	X
800-year-old	X
structure	X

I	X
saw	X
no	X
one	X
else	X
for	X
more	X
than	X
12	X
hours	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
only	X
signs	X
of	X
civilization	X
I	X
saw	X
were	X
the	X
crumbling	X
pueblo	X
and	X
a	X
cell	X

blinking	X
some	X
30	X
miles	X
away	X

the	X

no	X
shortage	X
of	X
articles	X
out	X
there	X
to	X
help	X
you	X
in	X
your	X
quest	X
.	X

The	X
advice	X
is	X
usually	X
pretty	X
simple	X
:	X
Use	X
a	X
slow	X
shutter	X
speed	X
,	X
bring	X
a	X
tripod	X
,	X
just	X
try	X
to	X
keep	X
things	X
steady	X

if	X
you	X
're	X
like	X
me	X
,	X
after	X
a	X
few	X
hours	X
at	X
a	X
barbecue	X

option	X

A	X
few	X
years	X
ago	X
I	X
stumbled	X
onto	X
the	X
perfect	X
solution	X

I	X
pulled	X
my	X
phone	X
out	X
during	X
a	X
fireworks	X
display	X
and	X
,	X
without	X
thinking	X
,	X
hit	X
the	X
record	X
button	X
.	X

It	X
took	X
a	X
few	X
seconds	X
before	X
I	X
realized	X
that	X
I	X
was	X
recording	X
video	X
,	X
not	X
still	X
images	X
.	X

My	X
first	X
instinct	X
was	X
to	X
switch	X
back	X
to	X
taking	X
stills	X
,	X
but	X
when	X
I	X
actually	X
looked	X
at	X
what	X
I	X
was	X
recording	X
,	X
I	X
was	X
much	X
happier	X
with	X
the	X
results	X
.	X

The	X
video	X
you	X
can	X
get	X
these	X
dayseven	X
with	X

incredibly	X
sharp	X
and	X
lifelike	X

and	X
using	X
it	X
to	X
capture	X
a	X

comes	X
with	X
all	X
kinds	X

captures	X
the	X

half	X

audio	X

Even	X
if	X
high-res	X
photos	X
are	X
what	X
you	X
're	X
after	X
,	X
you	X
can	X
just	X
pull	X
a	X
still	X
from	X
the	X
video	X

so	X
if	X
your	X

has	X
a	X
60fps	X
option	X

use	X
that	X

those	X

also	X
produce	X

being	X
that	X
these	X

usually	X
do	X
n't	X

So	X
that	X
's	X
my	X
secret	X
.	X

Forget	X
photos	X
and	X
try	X
capturing	X
fireworks	X
with	X
video	X
instead	X
.	X

Why	X
?	X

Because	X
capturing	X
video	X
of	X
fireworks	X
is	X
the	X
easiest	X
thing	X
in	X
the	X
world	X
,	X
and	X
you	X
are	X
n't	X
"	X
that	X
guy	X
"	X
lugging	X
a	X
10-pound	X

around	X
.	X

Great	X
results	X
with	X
minimal	X
effort	X
?	X

Now	X
that	X
's	X
something	X
worth	X
celebrating	X
.	X

The	X
Great	X

off	X
the	X

is	X
home	X

Will	X

Before	X

Radke	X

it	X

The	X
toxic	X
culprit	X
of	X
ciguatera	X
(	X
say	X
sig-WAH-terra	X
)	X
is	X
made	X
by	X
microscopic	X
algae	X

These	X

organisms	X

Small	X
fish	X
do	X
n't	X
get	X
sick	X
when	X
they	X
eat	X
the	X
algae	X

but	X
the	X
toxin	X
(	X
called	X
ciguatoxin	X
)	X
is	X
stored	X
in	X
their	X
bodies	X
.	X

When	X
larger	X
fish	X
eat	X
the	X
small	X
fish	X

the	X
toxin	X
accumulates	X

Humans	X
who	X
eat	X
large	X
fish	X
full	X
of	X
ciguatoxin	X
can	X
be	X
poisoned	X

A	X
case	X
of	X
ciguatera	X
typically	X
involves	X
vomiting	X

diarrhea	X

nausea	X

cramps	X

At	X
higher	X
doses	X
,	X
the	X
toxin	X
triggers	X
neurological	X

such	X
as	X
the	X
reversal	X
of	X
the	X
sensations	X
of	X
hot	X

Some	X
people	X
report	X
dizziness	X

The	X
illness	X
is	X
rarely	X
fatal	X
,	X
but	X
symptoms	X
can	X
last	X
for	X
weeks	X
or	X
even	X
years	X

The	X

were	X
published	X
Monday	X
in	X
The	X
American	X
Journal	X
of	X
Tropical	X

Hygiene	X
.	X

Since	X
ciguatoxin	X
is	X
most	X
concentrated	X
in	X
large	X
tropical	X
fish	X
,	X
such	X
as	X
barracuda	X
,	X
grouper	X
,	X
amberjack	X
and	X
hogfish	X
,	X
the	X
scientists	X
emailed	X
thousands	X
of	X
surveys	X
to	X
recreational	X
saltwater	X
fishermen	X
asking	X
about	X
health	X
issues	X

the	X
fish	X

Had	X
the	X

ever	X

?	X

Had	X
they	X
ever	X
experienced	X
its	X
telltale	X
symptoms	X
after	X

One	X
advantage	X
of	X
the	X
surveys	X
,	X
Radke	X
says	X
,	X
is	X
that	X
fishermen	X
are	X
more	X
likely	X
to	X
be	X
able	X
to	X
identify	X
a	X
fish	X
they	X

it	X

Wayne	X

ecologist	X
with	X
the	X
National	X
Oceanic	X
and	X
Atmospheric	X
Administration	X
in	X
North	X

says	X
the	X
survey	X
approach	X
makes	X
sense	X
.	X

"	X
There	X
's	X
really	X
no	X
optimal	X
way	X
to	X
do	X
it	X

They	X

Litaker	X

Another	X
source	X
of	X
confusion	X
is	X
that	X
fish	X
that	X
may	X
be	X
contaminated	X
are	X
shipped	X
all	X
over	X
the	X
world	X
.	X

People	X
who	X
eat	X
one	X
containing	X
ciguatoxin	X
may	X
not	X
know	X
what	X
the	X
fish	X
was	X
or	X
where	X
it	X
came	X
from	X
.	X

Even	X
if	X
they	X
do	X
develop	X
the	X
classic	X
neurological	X
symptoms	X
,	X
their	X
doctors	X
may	X
have	X
never	X
seen	X
ciguatera	X
before	X
.	X

Litaker	X
says	X
the	X
solution	X
is	X
"	X
improved	X
public	X
outreach	X
and	X
better	X
training	X
of	X
physicians	X
.	X
"	X

Radke	X
agrees	X
.	X

"	X
There	X
are	X
fish	X

like	X
barracuda	X

that	X

should	X
n't	X

all	X

she	X
says	X
.	X

Barracuda	X
may	X
be	X
the	X
worst	X
offenders	X
,	X
but	X
people	X
need	X
to	X
be	X
aware	X
of	X
other	X
potentially	X
toxic	X
fish	X
,	X
and	X
go	X
to	X
a	X
doctor	X
if	X
they	X
start	X
to	X
feel	X
sick	X
.	X

Climate	X

expand	X
the	X
range	X
of	X
the	X
toxic	X
dinoflagellates	X

poisoning	X
might	X
show	X
up	X
in	X
places	X

there	X

Greece	X

has	X
put	X
his	X
political	X
clout	X
behind	X
the	X
"	X

whether	X
the	X

the	X
terms	X

But	X
the	X
people	X
appear	X
to	X
be	X
evenly	X
split	X
on	X
the	X
issue	X
,	X
according	X
to	X
two	X
new	X
opinion	X
polls	X
.	X

One	X
survey	X
,	X
conducted	X
by	X
the	X
respected	X
ALCO	X
institute	X
just	X
48	X
hours	X
before	X
the	X
referendum	X
that	X
could	X

Greece	X

44.8	X

43.4	X
percent	X
for	X
the	X
"	X
no	X
"	X
side	X
,	X
according	X
to	X
Reuters	X
.	X

But	X
a	X
second	X
poll	X
,	X
conducted	X
by	X
Public	X
Issue	X
and	X
published	X
in	X
the	X
ruling	X
party	X
's	X
newspaper	X

reports	X
a	X
0.5-percentage-point	X
lead	X
for	X
those	X
opposed	X
to	X
the	X
bailout	X
.	X

Given	X
the	X
margin	X
of	X
error	X
in	X
the	X
surveys	X
,	X
what	X
seems	X
clear	X
is	X
that	X
the	X
referendum	X
could	X
go	X
either	X
way	X
when	X
Greeks	X
cast	X
their	X
ballots	X
on	X
Sunday	X
.	X

The	X
referendum	X
was	X
announced	X
a	X
week	X
ago	X
by	X
Prime	X
Minister	X
Alexis	X
Tsipras	X
after	X
his	X
government	X
failed	X
to	X
get	X
terms	X
it	X
deemed	X
acceptable	X
from	X
the	X
European	X
Union	X
and	X
the	X
International	X
Monetary	X
Fund	X
.	X

As	X
a	X
result	X
,	X
Athens	X
missed	X
a	X
Tuesday	X
deadline	X
and	X
defaulted	X
on	X
a	X
payment	X
it	X
owed	X
the	X
IMF	X
.	X

The	X
crisis	X
triggered	X
a	X
virtual	X
run	X
on	X
the	X
banks	X
that	X
forced	X
the	X
country	X
to	X
declare	X
an	X
extended	X
bank	X
holiday	X
and	X
limit	X
ATM	X
withdrawals	X
.	X

Tsipras	X
on	X
Friday	X
reiterated	X
his	X
opposition	X
to	X
the	X
deal	X
,	X
insisting	X
that	X
an	X
International	X
Monetary	X
Fund	X
analysis	X
showing	X
that	X
his	X
country	X
's	X
debt	X
is	X
unsustainable	X
was	X
"	X
a	X
great	X
vindication	X
"	X
for	X
him	X
in	X
pushing	X
rejection	X
of	X
the	X
international	X
deal	X
that	X
offers	X
no	X
debt	X
relief	X
.	X

He	X
has	X
called	X
the	X
proposed	X
bailout	X
plan	X
"	X
blackmail	X
and	X
ultimatums	X
.	X
"	X

But	X
,	X
as	X
Joanna	X
Kakissis	X
reports	X
for	X
NPR	X
from	X
Athens	X
,	X
"	X
European	X
leaders	X
are	X
begging	X
Greeks	X
to	X
vote	X
'	X

A	X

Greek	X

German	X
with	X
the	X
message	X
'	X
stay	X

us	X

'	X

"	X

Even	X
so	X
,	X
those	X
same	X
leaders	X
suggest	X
that	X
regardless	X
the	X
outcome	X
,	X
the	X
vote	X
is	X
unlikely	X
to	X
resolve	X
the	X
impasse	X

Introductory	X
Video	X

On	X
18	X
September	X
1997	X
,	X
the	X
people	X
of	X
Wales	X
voted	X
in	X
a	X
referendum	X
on	X
devolution	X
.	X

They	X
may	X
have	X
voted	X
yes	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
was	X
by	X
the	X
thinnest	X
of	X
margins	X
-	X
50.3	X
%	X
to	X
49.7	X
%	X
.	X

Nevertheless	X
,	X
a	X
new	X
dawn	X
had	X
broken	X
,	X
as	X
the	X
then-Welsh	X
Secretary	X
Ron	X
Davies	X
claimed	X
.	X

Although	X
wheels	X
were	X
set	X
in	X
motion	X
for	X
a	X
National	X
Assembly	X
for	X
Wales	X
,	X
those	X
in	X
favour	X
had	X
a	X
huge	X
task	X
to	X
convince	X
those	X
who	X
had	X
voted	X
against	X
it	X
-	X
and	X
those	X
who	X
had	X
n't	X
voted	X
at	X
all	X
-	X
that	X
it	X
would	X
benefit	X
the	X
country	X
.	X

With	X
that	X
challenge	X
in	X
mind	X
,	X
Mr	X
Davies	X
famously	X
said	X
that	X
"	X
devolution	X
is	X
a	X
process	X
,	X
not	X
an	X
event	X
.	X

That	X
proved	X
to	X
be	X
the	X
case	X
.	X

The	X
Government	X
of	X
Wales	X
Act	X
1998	X
established	X
the	X
Assembly	X
but	X
it	X
was	X
n't	X
until	X
a	X
second	X
act	X
in	X
2006	X
that	X
it	X
gained	X
the	X
ability	X
to	X
make	X
its	X
own	X
laws	X
from	X
scratch	X
rather	X
than	X
adapting	X
legislation	X
created	X
in	X
Westminster	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
the	X
Assembly	X
still	X
had	X
to	X
ask	X

said	X
Thursday	X

Restarting	X
the	X

to	X
capture	X

replace	X

The	X
revelation	X
in	X
April	X
that	X
scientists	X
had	X
edited	X
the	X
genome	X
of	X
a	X
human	X
embryo	X
an	X
inevitable	X
development	X
to	X
anyone	X
paying	X
attention	X
to	X
biotechnological	X
advances	X
has	X
sparked	X
the	X
biggest	X
bioethical	X
debate	X
of	X
the	X
year	X
and	X
one	X
that	X
will	X
last	X
for	X
decades	X
.	X

The	X
overwhelming	X
consensus	X
is	X
that	X
such	X
embryos	X
should	X
not	X
be	X
brought	X
to	X
term	X
in	X
clinical	X
settings	X
at	X
least	X
not	X
for	X
now	X

The	X
debate	X
over	X
when	X
,	X
if	X
ever	X
,	X
that	X
should	X
take	X
place	X
has	X
played	X
out	X
in	X
the	X
scientific	X
literature	X
in	X
duelling	X
articles	X
,	X
arguments	X
about	X
the	X
technology	X
's	X
efficacy	X
and	X
calls	X
for	X
an	X
Asilomar-like	X
conference	X
on	X
bioethics	X
.	X

So	X
it	X
is	X
little	X
surprise	X
that	X
lawmakers	X
are	X
weighing	X
in	X
.	X

On	X
16	X
June	X
,	X
a	X
subcommittee	X
of	X
the	X
US	X
House	X
Committee	X
on	X
Space	X
,	X
Science	X
and	X
Technology	X
held	X
a	X
hearing	X
on	X
human	X
gene	X
editing	X
with	X
witnesses	X
who	X
included	X
Jennifer	X
Doudna	X
,	X
a	X
biochemist	X
at	X
the	X
University	X
of	X
California	X
,	X
Berkeley	X
,	X
who	X
was	X
one	X
of	X
the	X
inventors	X
of	X
the	X
genome-editing	X
system	X
CRISPR	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
Institute	X
of	X
Medicine	X
(	X
IOM	X
)	X
president	X
Victor	X
Dzau	X
.	X

The	X
climate	X
was	X
more	X
educational	X
than	X
controversial	X
,	X
with	X
lawmakers	X
asking	X
the	X
usual	X
questions	X
about	X
the	X
risks	X
,	X
benefits	X
and	X
ethics	X
of	X
engineering	X
future	X
generations	X
of	X
the	X
human	X
race	X
.	X

Parallels	X
were	X
drawn	X
with	X
another	X
ongoing	X
debate	X
over	X
'	X
three-parent	X
embryos	X
'	X
,	X
in	X
which	X
an	X
egg	X
cell	X
's	X
diseased	X
mitochondria	X
are	X
replaced	X
with	X
healthy	X

from	X
a	X

A	X
decision	X
on	X
whether	X
to	X
allow	X
that	X
procedure	X
in	X
the	X
United	X
States	X
is	X
in	X
the	X
hands	X
of	X
the	X
US	X
Food	X
and	X
Drug	X
Administration	X
(	X
FDA	X
)	X
,	X
which	X
has	X
commissioned	X
an	X
IOM	X
report	X
on	X
the	X
topic	X
that	X
is	X
due	X
this	X
winter	X
.	X

While	X
the	X
research	X
and	X
technology	X
subcommittee	X
grilled	X
the	X
experts	X
,	X
a	X
separate	X
subcommittee	X
of	X
the	X
House	X
Appropriations	X
Committee	X
that	X
funds	X
the	X
FDA	X
was	X
meeting	X
elsewhere	X
on	X
Capitol	X
Hill	X
to	X
draft	X
the	X
agency	X
's	X
2016	X
budget	X
.	X

The	X
subcommittee	X
wants	X
to	X
take	X
no	X
chances	X
with	X
human	X
modification	X
:	X
a	X
bill	X
that	X
it	X
released	X
on	X
17	X
June	X
bans	X
the	X
FDA	X
from	X
using	X
public	X
funds	X
to	X
evaluate	X
applications	X
for	X
clinical	X
trials	X
involving	X
genetically	X
modified	X
human	X
embryos	X
.	X

Ironically	X
,	X
the	X
current	X
wording	X
could	X
backfire	X
:	X
applications	X
for	X
permission	X
to	X
investigate	X
new	X
drugs	X
are	X
automatically	X
approved	X
in	X
30	X
days	X
unless	X
the	X
FDA	X
blocks	X
them	X
,	X
which	X
would	X
require	X
funds	X
.	X

If	X
the	X
budget	X
passes	X
,	X
this	X
clause	X
would	X
be	X
the	X
first	X
time	X
that	X
lawmakers	X
have	X
used	X
the	X
FDA	X
to	X
limit	X
human	X
embryo	X
research	X
.	X

A	X
1996	X
law	X
known	X
as	X
the	X
DickeyWicker	X
Amendment	X
bans	X
the	X
use	X
of	X
federal	X
funds	X
to	X
create	X
human	X
embryos	X
for	X
research	X
,	X
but	X
does	X
not	X
pertain	X
to	X
FDA	X
regulation	X
.	X

The	X
National	X
Institutes	X
of	X
Health	X
(	X
NIH	X
)	X
reaffirmed	X
in	X
April	X
that	X
heritable	X
genetic	X
modification	X
falls	X
under	X
the	X
DickeyWicker	X
rule	X
,	X
and	X
director	X
Francis	X
Collins	X
said	X
that	X
clinical	X
application	X
of	X
such	X
technology	X
is	X
"	X
viewed	X
almost	X
universally	X
as	X
a	X
line	X
that	X
should	X
not	X
be	X
crossed	X
"	X
.	X

"	X
This	X
clause	X
would	X
be	X
the	X
first	X
time	X
that	X
lawmakers	X
have	X
used	X
the	X
FDA	X
to	X
limit	X
human	X
embryo	X
research	X
.	X
"	X

Nevertheless	X
,	X
Congress	X
is	X
determined	X
to	X
have	X
a	X
say	X
.	X

Deeply	X
embedded	X
in	X
a	X
report	X
accompanying	X
the	X
appropriations	X
bill	X
are	X
orders	X
from	X
the	X
funding	X
committee	X
that	X
the	X
FDA	X
appoints	X
"	X
an	X
independent	X
panel	X
of	X
experts	X
,	X
including	X
those	X
from	X
faith-based	X
institutions	X
with	X
expertise	X
on	X
bioethics	X
and	X
faith-based	X
medical	X
associations	X
"	X
to	X
evaluate	X
the	X
IOM	X
three-parent	X
embryo	X
report	X
when	X
it	X
is	X
released	X
and	X
to	X
report	X
back	X
.	X

Although	X
the	X
FDA	X
budget	X
is	X
far	X
from	X
becoming	X
law	X
after	X
undergoing	X
another	X
round	X
of	X
editing	X
,	X
it	X
must	X
still	X
be	X
passed	X
by	X
Congress	X
and	X
the	X
Senate	X
and	X
signed	X
by	X
the	X
president	X
the	X
implication	X
is	X
clear	X
.	X

The	X
powerful	X
spending	X
committee	X
that	X
holds	X
the	X
purse	X
strings	X
wants	X
to	X
be	X
involved	X
in	X
the	X
debate	X
:	X
an	X
understandable	X
and	X
indeed	X
necessary	X
position	X
.	X

Still	X
,	X
even	X
allowing	X
for	X
political	X
posturing	X
,	X
the	X
apparent	X
pre-emptive	X
distrust	X
of	X
the	X
IOM	X
's	X
highly	X
respected	X
peer-review	X
process	X
is	X
alarming	X
.	X

The	X
perennially	X
underfunded	X
FDA	X
has	X
already	X
spent	X
US	X
$	X
1.17	X
million	X
on	X
the	X
IOM	X
committee	X
,	X
and	X
although	X
no	X
budget	X
is	X
set	X
aside	X
for	X
the	X
new	X
panel	X
,	X
it	X
will	X
soak	X
up	X
money	X
that	X
could	X
be	X
spent	X
elsewhere	X
.	X

Also	X
worrisome	X
is	X
the	X
religious	X
language	X
,	X
which	X
harks	X
back	X
to	X
2010	X
when	X
a	X
court	X
ruled	X
in	X
favour	X
of	X
religious	X
organizations'	X
interpretation	X
of	X
DickeyWicker	X
and	X
briefly	X
shut	X
down	X
all	X
NIH-funded	X
human	X
embryonic	X
stem-cell	X
research	X
.	X

As	X
this	X
journal	X
has	X
said	X
,	X
all	X
voices	X
,	X
including	X
those	X
of	X
faith-based	X
groups	X
,	X
should	X
be	X
heard	X
in	X
the	X
debate	X
over	X
human-genome	X
editing	X
;	X
indeed	X
,	X
the	X
input	X
of	X
highly	X
influential	X
religious	X
groups	X
is	X
essential	X
to	X
make	X
a	X
decision	X
on	X
how	X
and	X
if	X
to	X
regulate	X
,	X
especially	X
in	X
the	X
United	X
States	X
.	X

But	X
the	X
IOM	X
committee	X
already	X
includes	X
a	X
professor	X
of	X
religious	X
studies	X
so	X
why	X
duplicate	X
the	X
effort	X
?	X

This	X
mandate	X
to	X
the	X
FDA	X
is	X
not	X
one	X
that	X
should	X
come	X
from	X
a	X
secular	X
government	X
,	X
which	X
seems	X
to	X
be	X
seeking	X
to	X
impress	X
conservative	X
supporters	X
.	X

As	X
one	X
ethicist	X
put	X
it	X
:	X
"	X
It	X
is	X
a	X
sign	X
that	X
the	X
culture	X
wars	X
are	X
n't	X
dead	X
.	X
"	X

When	X
it	X
comes	X
to	X
human-genome	X
editing	X
,	X
however	X
,	X
those	X
wars	X
are	X
a	X
reality	X
that	X
all	X
must	X
face	X
and	X
that	X
is	X
a	X
good	X
thing	X
.	X

This	X
opening	X
salvo	X
from	X
Congress	X
shows	X
just	X
how	X
complex	X
the	X
coming	X
debate	X
over	X
human	X
genomic	X
modification	X
will	X
be	X
.	X

Academics	X
have	X
spent	X
the	X
past	X
months	X
debating	X
among	X
themselves	X
how	X
to	X
proceed	X
with	X
research	X
and	X
clinical	X
applications	X
,	X
sometimes	X
acting	X
as	X
though	X
they	X
will	X
be	X
the	X
arbiters	X
of	X
the	X
final	X
decision	X
.	X

As	X
public	X
awareness	X
of	X
the	X
technology	X
increases	X
,	X
that	X
ethical	X
discussion	X
will	X
rightly	X
be	X
taken	X
out	X
of	X
their	X
hands	X
alone	X
and	X
planted	X
firmly	X
in	X
those	X
of	X
broader	X
society	X
.	X

As	X
any	X
reader	X
of	X
detective	X
fiction	X
knows	X
,	X
a	X
crucial	X
clue	X
needed	X
to	X
solve	X
a	X
murder	X
is	X
the	X
time	X
of	X
death	X
.	X

The	X
hero	X
detective	X
,	X
typically	X
,	X
is	X
frustrated	X
by	X
the	X
vague	X
responses	X
of	X
the	X
forensics	X
team	X
:	X
"	X
sometime	X
between	X
Tuesday	X
night	X
and	X
Thursday	X
morning	X
"	X
does	X
little	X
to	X
narrow	X
down	X
the	X
range	X
of	X
suspects	X
.	X

Scientists	X
have	X
long	X
tried	X
to	X
help	X
.	X

And	X
forensic	X
science	X
,	X
with	X
DNA	X
analysis	X
at	X
the	X
forefront	X
,	X
now	X
ensures	X
that	X
more	X
real-life	X
criminals	X
can	X
expect	X
a	X
knock	X
on	X
the	X
door	X
,	X
sometimes	X
decades	X
after	X
they	X
thought	X
they	X
had	X
evaded	X
detection	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
it	X
remains	X
effectively	X
impossible	X
to	X
accurately	X
judge	X
the	X
age	X
of	X
a	X
bloodstain	X
.	X

Corpse	X
excluded	X
,	X
bloodstains	X
are	X
typically	X
the	X
most	X
common	X
piece	X
of	X
evidence	X
encountered	X
at	X
a	X
homicidal-crime	X
scene	X
.	X

Colour	X
could	X
be	X
the	X
key	X
.	X

After	X
blood	X
leaves	X
the	X
body	X
it	X
starts	X
to	X
dry	X
;	X
as	X
it	X
does	X
so	X
,	X
it	X
changes	X
from	X
red	X
to	X
brown	X
.	X

Back	X
in	X
1907	X
,	X
the	X
Italian	X
researcher	X
Louis	X
Tomellini	X
produced	X
a	X
chart	X
of	X
12	X
bloody	X
spots	X
,	X
to	X
illustrate	X
this	X
colour	X
change	X
over	X
a	X
year	X
.	X

As	X
forensic	X
science	X
developed	X
through	X
the	X
twentieth	X
century	X

By	X
the	X
1960s	X
,	X
researchers	X
were	X
using	X
photospectrometry	X
,	X
recording	X
reflectance	X
spectra	X
and	X
working	X
out	X
how	X
the	X
rate	X
of	X
Tomellini	X
's	X
colour	X
changes	X
could	X
be	X
affected	X
by	X
different	X
atmospheric	X
conditions	X
.	X

These	X
are	X
useful	X
observations	X
,	X
and	X
forensic	X
analysis	X
of	X
the	X
colour	X
of	X
bloodstains	X
is	X
today	X
a	X
common	X
part	X
of	X
the	X
forensics	X
team	X
's	X
work	X
.	X

But	X
the	X
results	X
are	X
still	X
too	X
variable	X
for	X
the	X
analysis	X
to	X
stand	X
up	X
in	X
court	X
.	X

Colour	X
provides	X
more-useful	X
data	X
than	X
many	X
might	X
think	X

Spectrometry	X
is	X
a	X
valuable	X
technique	X
in	X
many	X
areas	X
,	X
from	X
drug	X
discovery	X
to	X
environmental	X
monitoring	X
.	X

And	X
astronomers	X
use	X
spectrometers	X
to	X
probe	X
the	X
atmospheres	X
of	X
distant	X
exoplanets	X
for	X
conditions	X
that	X
might	X
support	X
life	X
.	X

Spectrometers	X
,	X
in	X
other	X
words	X
,	X
have	X
become	X
indispensable	X
instruments	X
.	X

But	X
they	X
tend	X
to	X
be	X
expensive	X
,	X
complex	X
machines	X
.	X

The	X
most	X
precise	X
can	X
also	X
be	X
bulky	X

making	X
them	X
difficult	X
to	X

They	X
have	X
built	X
an	X
optical	X

is	X
both	X
small	X

How	X
can	X
science	X
address	X
the	X
gender-inequality	X
problem	X
?	X

It	X
is	X
a	X
persistent	X
issue	X
that	X
has	X
been	X
highlighted	X
again	X
by	X
the	X
controversy	X
over	X
the	X
recent	X
comments	X
by	X
Nobel	X
laureate	X
Tim	X
Hunt	X
about	X
his	X
"	X
trouble	X
with	X
girls	X
"	X
?	X

The	X
problem	X
in	X
biomedical	X
research	X
was	X
starkly	X
demonstrated	X
to	X
me	X
just	X
before	X
I	X
became	X
director	X
of	X
the	X
Walter	X
and	X
Eliza	X
Hall	X
Institute	X
of	X
Medical	X
Research	X
in	X
Melbourne	X
,	X
Australia	X
,	X
in	X
2009	X
.	X

I	X
chaired	X
my	X
first	X
meeting	X
of	X
the	X
senior	X
academic	X
staff	X
and	X
,	X
despite	X
having	X
had	X
a	X
high-profile	X
female	X
director	X
Suzanne	X
Cory	X
for	X
more	X
than	X
a	X
decade	X
none	X
of	X
the	X
20	X
department	X
heads	X
or	X
professors	X
in	X
the	X
room	X
were	X
women	X
.	X

I	X
pledged	X
to	X
improve	X
the	X
gender	X
balance	X
,	X
and	X
five	X
years	X
on	X
,	X
I	X
think	X
we	X
have	X
made	X
some	X
progress	X
.	X

We	X
now	X
have	X
four	X
female	X
professors	X
or	X
department	X
heads	X
.	X

That	X
is	X
hardly	X
a	X
reason	X
for	X
wild	X
celebration	X
,	X
but	X
given	X
that	X
we	X
began	X
from	X
such	X
a	X
woeful	X
base	X
it	X
is	X
a	X
start	X
.	X

So	X
what	X
have	X
we	X
done	X
?	X

Simply	X
,	X
we	X
asked	X
the	X
people	X
affected	X
women	X
in	X
their	X
postdoctoral	X
period	X
for	X
their	X
ideas	X
.	X

For	X
our	X
institute	X
,	X
some	X
of	X
the	X
simplest	X
changes	X
included	X
steps	X
to	X
ensure	X
that	X
all	X
important	X
meetings	X
are	X
held	X
within	X
school	X
hours	X
,	X
to	X
make	X
sure	X
that	X
researchers	X
with	X
child-care	X
duties	X
can	X
attend	X
.	X

We	X
have	X
also	X
set	X
up	X
a	X
dedicated	X
office	X
with	X
hot-desks	X
and	X
an	X
adjoining	X
room	X
in	X
which	X
small	X
children	X
can	X
play	X
and	X
older	X
children	X
can	X
do	X
homework	X
or	X
watch	X
television	X
,	X
under	X
the	X
supervision	X
of	X
their	X
parents	X
.	X

"	X
We	X
demand	X
that	X
at	X
least	X
half	X
of	X
speakers	X
at	X
conferences	X
organized	X
by	X
the	X
institute	X
are	X
women	X
.	X
"	X

And	X
we	X
designated	X
a	X
separate	X
room	X
to	X
allow	X
women	X
to	X
breastfeed	X
their	X
infants	X
or	X
to	X
express	X
milk	X
.	X

The	X
idea	X
of	X
women	X
expressing	X
milk	X
in	X
a	X
toilet	X
or	X
a	X
sick	X
room	X
as	X
was	X
done	X
before	X
seems	X
as	X
inappropriate	X
as	X
having	X
a	X
researcher	X
making	X
their	X
coffee	X
there	X
.	X

What	X
else	X
?	X

We	X
demand	X
that	X
at	X
least	X
half	X
of	X
speakers	X
at	X
all	X
conferences	X
and	X
workshops	X
organized	X
by	X
the	X
institute	X
are	X
women	X
.	X

And	X
we	X
created	X
a	X
gender-equality	X
committee	X
,	X
with	X
men	X
and	X
women	X
,	X
to	X
monitor	X
implementation	X
of	X
policies	X
,	X
gather	X
data	X
on	X
progress	X
and	X
challenge	X
us	X
with	X
new	X
ideas	X
.	X

That	X
was	X
the	X
easy	X
stuff	X
.	X

Some	X
steps	X
required	X
more	X
thought	X
,	X
major	X
investment	X
and	X
time	X
.	X

The	X
trend	X
over	X
the	X
past	X
30	X
years	X
of	X
postponing	X
scientific	X
independence	X
by	X
having	X
researchers	X
work	X
for	X
longer	X
as	X
postdocs	X
is	X
generally	X
problematic	X
,	X
but	X
especially	X
difficult	X
for	X
many	X
women	X
,	X
because	X
those	X
career-defining	X
years	X
overlap	X
with	X
child-bearing	X
years	X
.	X

Female	X
postdocs	X
are	X
placed	X
in	X
an	X
invidious	X
position	X
:	X
take	X
some	X
time	X
off	X
and	X
have	X
your	X
productivity	X
drop	X
to	X
near-zero	X
for	X
a	X
period	X
,	X
or	X
postpone	X
having	X
children	X
in	X
the	X
hope	X
of	X
obtaining	X
a	X
faculty	X
position	X
.	X

So	X
we	X
deliberately	X
started	X
to	X
appoint	X
faculty	X
members	X
at	X
a	X
younger	X
age	X
,	X
in	X
their	X
early	X
to	X
mid-thirties	X
,	X
perhaps	X
after	X
a	X
24	X
year	X
period	X
as	X
postdocs	X
.	X

This	X
provides	X
women	X
with	X
resources	X
they	X
can	X
use	X
(	X
postdocs	X
,	X
research	X
assistants	X
and	X
students	X
of	X
their	X
own	X
)	X
should	X
they	X
take	X
time	X
out	X
from	X
full-time	X
work	X
to	X
have	X
children	X
and	X
to	X
care	X
for	X
them	X
.	X

For	X
women	X
who	X
have	X
children	X
during	X
their	X
postdocs	X
,	X
we	X
offer	X
technical	X
support	X
,	X
paid	X
for	X
by	X
the	X
institute	X
to	X
make	X
sure	X
that	X
their	X
projects	X
progress	X
while	X
they	X
are	X
on	X
maternity	X
leave	X
.	X

We	X
introduced	X
a	X
5-year	X
,	X
Aus	X
$	X
1.25-million	X
(	X
US	X
$	X
960,000	X
)	X
fellowship	X
to	X
support	X
a	X
female	X
laboratory	X
head	X
,	X
who	X
can	X
spend	X
the	X
money	X
as	X
she	X
wishes	X
.	X

It	X
can	X
pay	X
for	X
salaries	X
,	X
for	X
instance	X
,	X
or	X
for	X
consumable	X
expenses	X
.	X

And	X
,	X
given	X
that	X
the	X
high	X
cost	X
of	X
child	X
care	X
can	X
prevent	X
women	X
from	X
returning	X
to	X
work	X
,	X
the	X
institute	X
helps	X
to	X
pay	X
for	X
it	X
up	X
to	X
Aus	X
$	X
15,000	X
each	X
year	X
for	X
female	X
postdocs	X
and	X
lab	X
heads	X
with	X
pre-school-age	X
children	X
.	X

Yes	X
,	X
men	X
pay	X
for	X
child	X
care	X
too	X
,	X
but	X
we	X
have	X
a	X
surfeit	X
of	X
male	X
lab	X
heads	X
,	X
and	X
we	X
cannot	X
afford	X
to	X
do	X
it	X
for	X
everyone	X
.	X

We	X
also	X
pay	X
for	X
our	X
female	X
scientists	X
to	X
take	X
children	X
and	X
a	X
carer	X
with	X
them	X
to	X
academic	X
conferences	X
,	X
both	X
here	X
and	X
abroad	X
.	X

This	X
can	X
cost	X
hundreds	X
or	X
sometimes	X
a	X
few	X
thousand	X
dollars	X
,	X
but	X
we	X
think	X
that	X
presenting	X
at	X
meetings	X
is	X
important	X
for	X
career	X
development	X
.	X

We	X
also	X
pay	X
for	X
a	X
'	X
family	X
room	X
'	X
at	X
local	X
conferences	X
to	X
allow	X
researchers	X
to	X
listen	X
to	X
talks	X
while	X
accompanied	X
by	X
their	X
children	X
which	X
is	X
good	X
for	X
both	X
men	X
and	X
women	X
.	X

We	X
want	X
to	X
do	X
more	X
.	X

We	X
are	X
planning	X
an	X
on-site	X
child-care	X
centre	X
and	X
new	X
fellowships	X
to	X
support	X
women	X
returning	X
after	X
extended	X
leave	X
.	X

And	X
we	X
are	X
considering	X
making	X
the	X
lab-head	X
role	X
more	X
flexible	X
.	X

Could	X
it	X
be	X
done	X
as	X
a	X
job-share	X
,	X
for	X
example	X
,	X
with	X
two	X
faculty	X
members	X
splitting	X
supervisorial	X
responsibilities	X
,	X
each	X
working	X
three	X
days	X
a	X
week	X
?	X

We	X
know	X
that	X
these	X
steps	X
have	X
made	X
a	X
difference	X
.	X

Some	X
are	X
expensive	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
'	X
my-institute-has-no-money	X
'	X
argument	X
is	X
rarely	X
a	X
good	X
excuse	X
for	X
inaction	X
.	X

Every	X
institution	X
has	X
some	X
discretionary	X
money	X
and	X
can	X
choose	X
to	X
spend	X
it	X
in	X
these	X
ways	X
rather	X
than	X
,	X
say	X
,	X
on	X
over-generous	X
recruitment	X
packages	X
for	X
well-established	X
(	X
usually	X
male	X
)	X
scientists	X
.	X

Bigger	X
changes	X
have	X
occurred	X
when	X
we	X
have	X
spoken	X
openly	X
,	X
passionately	X
and	X
sometimes	X
bluntly	X

situation	X
and	X

challenges	X
faced	X
by	X

Empathize	X

The	X
first	X
phase	X
is	X
where	X
you	X
use	X
research	X
to	X
gain	X
an	X
understanding	X
about	X
whom	X
you	X
're	X
designing	X
for	X
.	X

You	X
do	X
this	X
by	X
interviewing	X
,	X
observing	X
,	X
and	X
immersing	X
yourself	X
in	X
the	X
experiences	X
of	X
others	X
.	X

Step	X
2	X
:	X
Define	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
where	X
you	X
define	X
the	X
problem	X
.	X

Notice	X
that	X
you	X
do	X
n't	X
start	X
the	X
process	X
with	X
a	X
problem	X
;	X
rather	X
,	X
you	X
start	X
with	X
people	X
and	X
then	X
move	X
to	X
a	X
problem	X
that	X
you	X
're	X
going	X
to	X
solve	X
.	X

Step	X
3	X
:	X
Ideation	X

Once	X
you	X
identify	X
the	X
problem	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
ideation	X
time	X
,	X
during	X
which	X
you	X
come	X
up	X
with	X
thousands	X
of	X
ideas	X
to	X
solve	X
that	X
problem	X
.	X

The	X
ideas	X
should	X
run	X
the	X

from	X
wild	X
and	X
crazy	X
to	X
feasible	X

the	X
one	X
Summit	X
attendees	X
did	X
on	X

Step	X
1	X
:	X
Identify	X
someone	X
at	X
your	X
table	X
to	X
partner	X
with	X
and	X
interview	X
your	X
partner	X
for	X
three	X
minutes	X
about	X
gift	X
giving	X
.	X

Take	X
notes	X
.	X

Here	X
are	X
some	X
questions	X
you	X
might	X
want	X
to	X
ask	X
:	X
What	X
is	X
the	X
last	X
gift	X
you	X
received	X
?	X

What	X
is	X
the	X
last	X
gift	X
you	X
gave	X
?	X

What	X
are	X
some	X
things	X
that	X
make	X
you	X
happy	X
?	X

How	X
do	X
spend	X
your	X
time	X
?	X

You	X
want	X
to	X
discover	X
what	X
delights	X
your	X
partner	X
and	X
you	X
want	X
to	X
ask	X
for	X
specific	X
stories	X
.	X

Switch	X
after	X
three	X
minutes	X
.	X

Step	X
2	X
:	X
Dig	X
deeper	X
to	X
get	X
past	X
surface-level	X
information	X
.	X

The	X
easiest	X
strategy	X
for	X
doing	X
this	X
is	X
by	X
asking	X
why	X
.	X

Look	X
at	X
the	X
information	X
you	X
have	X
written	X
,	X
pick	X
out	X
something	X
that	X
's	X
of	X
interest	X
to	X
you	X
,	X
and	X
ask	X
your	X
partner	X
to	X
tell	X
you	X
more	X
about	X
why	X
she	X
did	X
that	X
,	X
why	X
he	X
thinks	X
that	X
,	X
or	X
why	X
she	X
feels	X
that	X
way	X
.	X

Each	X
partner	X
gets	X
three	X
minutes	X
to	X
dig	X
deeper	X
about	X
into	X
the	X
partner	X
's	X
gift-giving	X
experience	X
.	X

Step	X
3	X
:	X
This	X
is	X
the	X
interpretation	X
part	X
of	X
the	X
process	X
.	X

For	X
some	X
people	X
,	X
this	X
is	X
scary	X
because	X
you	X
have	X
to	X
take	X
some	X
risks	X
and	X
make	X
some	X
assumptions	X
and	X
interpretations	X
about	X
the	X
data	X
you	X
collected	X
.	X

Try	X
and	X
capture	X
some	X
needs	X
you	X
believe	X
your	X
partner	X
has	X
regarding	X
gift	X
giving	X
and	X
/	X
or	X
receiving	X
.	X

The	X
needs	X
should	X
be	X
in	X
the	X
form	X
of	X
verbs	X
or	X
verb-like	X
phrases	X
,	X
such	X
as	X
"	X
needs	X
to	X
communicate	X
,"	X
"	X
needs	X
to	X
balance	X
,"	X
or	X
"	X
needs	X
to	X
spend	X
time	X
with	X
.	X
"	X

Complete	X
those	X
sentences	X
phrases	X
and	X
put	X
them	X
on	X
the	X
top	X
of	X
the	X
paper	X
in	X
front	X
of	X
you	X
;	X
on	X
the	X
bottom	X
part	X
is	X
where	X
you	X
will	X
write	X
your	X
insights	X
.	X

What	X
do	X
you	X
think	X
you	X
know	X
about	X
your	X
partner	X
now	X
,	X
based	X
on	X
what	X
he	X
or	X
she	X
shared	X
with	X
you	X
?	X

Spend	X
three	X
minutes	X
to	X
work	X
on	X
this	X
independently	X
.	X

Do	X
not	X
check	X
in	X
with	X
your	X
partner	X
or	X
validate	X
your	X
interpretations	X
.	X

Step	X
4	X
:	X
Defining	X
the	X
problem	X
is	X
a	X
critical	X
phase	X
of	X
the	X
design-thinking	X
process	X
.	X

Based	X
on	X
the	X
needs	X
and	X
the	X
insights	X
you	X
documented	X
in	X
step	X
three	X
,	X
you	X
get	X
to	X
choose	X
the	X
one	X
need	X
you	X
believe	X
your	X
partner	X
has	X
the	X
most	X
.	X

You	X
will	X
write	X
your	X
partner	X
's	X
name	X
at	X
the	X
top	X
,	X
and	X
write	X
one	X
need	X
from	X
your	X
list	X
and	X
one	X
insight	X
to	X
make	X
a	X
complete	X
need	X
statement	X
.	X

Step	X
5	X
:	X
You	X
are	X
transitioning	X
to	X
the	X
third	X
mode	X
of	X
the	X
process	X
,	X
which	X
is	X
to	X
ideate	X
.	X

In	X
the	X
last	X
step	X
you	X
wrote	X
the	X
problem	X
statement	X
.	X

Now	X
you	X
should	X
come	X
up	X
with	X
3	X
to	X
10or	X
even	X
moreideas	X
to	X
solve	X
your	X
partner	X
's	X
needs	X
or	X
come	X
up	X
with	X
a	X
way	X
to	X
delight	X
your	X
partner	X
.	X

Imagine	X
that	X
you	X
have	X
a	X
million	X
dollars	X
to	X
solve	X
this	X
problem	X
,	X
and	X
do	X
n't	X
think	X
about	X
obvious	X
solutions	X
.	X

Step	X
6	X
:	X
Next	X
,	X
you	X
get	X
to	X
share	X
some	X
of	X
your	X
ideas	X
with	X
your	X
partner	X
for	X
feedback	X
.	X

You	X
are	X
not	X
selling	X
your	X
ideas	X
;	X
you	X
are	X
simply	X
offering	X
them	X
feedback	X
.	X

You	X
are	X
looking	X
for	X
body	X
language	X
and	X
things	X
that	X
excite	X
your	X
partner	X
.	X

You	X
can	X
ask	X
questions	X
like	X
:	X
What	X
would	X
make	X
this	X
better	X
?	X

How	X
can	X
I	X
improve	X
this	X
?	X

Share	X
your	X
idea	X
and	X
get	X
feedback	X
for	X
three	X
minutes	X
and	X
then	X
switch	X
.	X

Steps	X
7	X
and	X
8	X
:	X
So	X
far	X
,	X
you	X
empathized	X
with	X
your	X
partner	X
by	X
interviewing	X
him	X
or	X
her	X
and	X
digging	X
deeper	X
.	X

Based	X
on	X
the	X
data	X
you	X
collected	X
,	X
you	X
defined	X
an	X
opportunity	X
or	X
a	X
problem	X
that	X
you	X
could	X
solve	X
or	X
design	X
around	X
.	X

In	X
the	X
last	X
round	X
,	X
you	X
ideated	X
some	X
ideas	X
and	X
shared	X
those	X
for	X
feedback	X
.	X

Based	X
on	X
that	X
feedback	X
,	X
you	X
're	X
going	X
to	X
select	X
the	X
one	X
idea	X
that	X
you	X
think	X
would	X
delight	X
your	X
partner	X
the	X
most	X
.	X

In	X
seven	X
minutes	X
you	X
're	X
going	X
to	X
do	X
two	X
things	X
:	X
First	X
,	X
in	X
30	X
to	X
60	X
seconds	X
,	X
you	X
will	X
sketch	X
that	X
idea	X
or	X
concept	X
.	X

Then	X
,	X
go	X
to	X
the	X
back	X
of	X
the	X
room	X
where	X
you	X
'll	X
find	X
some	X
low-resolution	X
prototyping	X
materials	X
(	X
i.e.	X
,	X
assorted	X
paper	X
,	X
glue	X
sticks	X
,	X
and	X
scissors	X
)	X
and	X
then	X
build	X
your	X
idea	X
or	X
a	X
tangible	X
representation	X
of	X
that	X
idea	X
for	X
your	X
partner	X

the	X

long	X
stereotyped	X

So	X
take	X
heart	X
,	X
dear	X
Texans	X

You	X
'd	X
have	X
to	X
try	X
real	X
hard	X
to	X
get	X
stung	X
by	X
these	X
things	X
,	X
like	X
picking	X
them	X
up	X
or	X
stepping	X
on	X
them	X
.	X

Quite	X
frankly	X
,	X
they	X
do	X
n't	X
seem	X
to	X
pay	X
people	X
no	X
mind	X
,	X
even	X
if	X
approached	X
,	X
probably	X
because	X
they	X
know	X
they	X
could	X
kick	X
human	X
asses	X
all	X
over	X
the	X
place	X

"	X
The	X
tarantula	X
hawks	X
are	X
really	X
bold	X
in	X
terms	X
of	X
wasps	X
,"	X
says	X
Hutchins	X

"	X
Researchers	X
think	X
that	X
's	X
because	X
they	X
have	X
very	X
few	X
natural	X
predators	X
.	X

They	X
have	X
such	X
an	X
effective	X
deterrent	X
mechanism	X
,	X
and	X
that	X
's	X
their	X
really	X
painful	X
sting	X
.	X
"	X

Indeed	X
,	X
there	X
are	X
almost	X
no	X
reports	X
of	X
any	X
animal	X
dumb	X
enough	X
going	X
after	X
these	X
things	X
.	X

Accordingly	X
,	X
there	X
's	X
not	X
much	X
to	X
stop	X
them	X
when	X
their	X
numbers	X
start	X
climbing	X
,	X
like	X
they	X
are	X
right	X
now	X
in	X

Thanks	X
to	X
a	X
strong	X
rainy	X
season	X
,	X
vegetation	X
is	X
doing	X
quite	X
well	X
,	X
and	X
when	X
vegetation	X
does	X
quite	X
well	X
,	X
so	X
do	X
insects	X
.	X

The	X
tarantula	X
hawk	X
is	X
actually	X
a	X
nectar-feeder	X
,	X
not	X
a	X
carnivore	X
,	X
so	X
it	X
's	X
in	X
fat	X
city	X
these	X
days	X
.	X

But	X
not	X
all	X
of	X
these	X
wasps	X
sting	X
:	X
The	X
males	X
ca	X
n't	X
do	X
it	X
at	X
all	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
because	X
stingers	X
in	X
the	X
insect	X
world	X
belong	X
to	X
the	X
females	X
(	X
the	X
structures	X
evolved	X
from	X
ovipositors	X
,	X
which	X
the	X
females	X
use	X
to	X
lay	X
eggs	X
)	X
.	X

So	X
in	X
lovely	X
conditions	X
such	X
as	X
these	X
,	X
males	X
will	X
hang	X
out	X
on	X
flowers	X
and	X
wait	X
for	X
the	X
females	X
to	X
come	X
around	X
and	X
mate	X
.	X

The	X
female	X
then	X
flies	X
offand	X
this	X
is	X
where	X
the	X
real	X
fun	X
begins	X
.	X

Except	X
for	X
the	X
tarantulas	X

They	X
're	X
not	X
going	X

one	X

Operation	X

Unlike	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
insects	X
,	X
the	X
fertilized	X
female	X
wo	X
n't	X
just	X
be	X
depositing	X
her	X
eggs	X
somewhere	X
and	X
flying	X
off	X
,	X
hoping	X
they	X
'll	X
survive	X
on	X
their	X
own	X
.	X

Nope	X
,	X
she	X
finds	X
an	X
unwitting	X
caretaker	X
first	X
:	X
specifically	X
,	X
any	X
number	X
of	X
tarantulas	X
that	X
are	X
also	X
good	X
and	X
active	X
during	X
these	X
times	X
of	X
plenty	X
.	X

The	X
she-wasp	X
has	X
to	X
be	X
careful	X
,	X
because	X
while	X
she	X
's	X
pretty	X
darn	X
big	X
,	X
the	X
tarantula	X
can	X
be	X
several	X
times	X
bigger	X
than	X
her	X
.	X

And	X
although	X
tarantulas	X
may	X
be	X
harmless	X
to	X
humans	X
,	X
they	X
have	X
massive	X
fangs	X
that	X
could	X
do	X
a	X
number	X
on	X
the	X
wasp	X
.	X

"	X
The	X
tarantula	X

"	X
back	X

and	X
then	X
go	X
in	X
and	X
actually	X
get	X
in	X
underneath	X
the	X
tarantula	X
and	X
then	X
flip	X
it	X
over	X
,	X
and	X
then	X
sting	X
it	X
.	X

She	X
's	X
usually	X
looking	X
for	X
a	X
chink	X
in	X
the	X
tarantula	X
's	X
armor	X

and	X
that	X

often	X
at	X
the	X
joints	X
in	X
the	X

"	X

And	X
she	X
's	X
really	X
good	X
at	X
it	X
.	X

One	X
survey	X
found	X
that	X
in	X
400	X
battles	X
,	X
only	X
a	X
single	X
wasp	X
perished	X

But	X
that	X
is	X
n't	X
to	X
say	X
the	X
tarantulas	X
were	X
n't	X
putting	X
up	X
a	X

fight	X
.	X

In	X
his	X
sneakily	X
comic	X
scientific	X
paper	X
,	X
Schmidt	X
notes	X
that	X
researchers	X
have	X
reported	X
"	X
violent	X
encounters	X
,	X
often	X
hearing	X
loud	X

As	X
for	X
the	X
tarantulas	X
,	X
well	X
,	X
they	X
almost	X
never	X
escape	X
.	X

The	X
sting	X
paralyzes	X
the	X
spider	X
nearly	X
instantly	X
,	X
allowing	X
the	X
wasp	X
to	X
drag	X
it	X
into	X
a	X
pre-dug	X
burrow	X
or	X
back	X
to	X
the	X
tarantula	X
's	X
own	X
den	X
.	X

Here	X
it	X
drops	X
the	X
victim	X
and	X
lays	X
a	X
single	X
egg	X
on	X
it	X
,	X
then	X
leaves	X
and	X
seals	X
the	X
chamber	X
behind	X
it	X
.	X

The	X
egg	X
hatches	X
into	X
a	X
larva	X
,	X
which	X
starts	X
eating	X
the	X
still-paralyzed	X
spider	X
,	X
focusing	X
on	X
non-essential	X
tissues	X
to	X
keep	X
it	X
alive	X
for	X
as	X
long	X
as	X
possibleperhaps	X
weeks	X
.	X

That	X
there	X
is	X
one	X
hell	X
of	X
a	X
head	X
start	X
in	X
life	X
for	X
the	X
kiddo	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
a	X
striking	X
contrast	X
to	X
the	X
lives	X
of	X
social	X
wasps	X
,	X
which	X
collectively	X
care	X
for	X
their	X
young	X
without	X
encouraging	X
them	X
to	X
devour	X
paralyzed	X
tarantulas	X
.	X

And	X
indeed	X
,	X
this	X
manifests	X
in	X
the	X
wasps'	X
venom	X
itself	X
.	X

Typically	X
,	X
the	X
venom	X
of	X
social	X
wasps	X
tends	X
to	X
be	X
both	X
painful	X
and	X
damaging	X
to	X
tissue	X
,	X
whereas	X
the	X
tarantula	X
hawk	X
's	X
is	X
all	X
agony	X
and	X
no	X
damage	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
likely	X
because	X
social	X
wasps	X
have	X
a	X
queen	X
and	X
young	X
to	X
protect	X
from	X
their	X
enemies	X
,	X
so	X
simply	X
inflicting	X
pain	X
may	X
not	X
do	X
the	X
trickthe	X
target	X
may	X
be	X
down	X
,	X
but	X
not	X
out	X
.	X

In	X
contrast	X
,	X
the	X
tarantula	X
hawk	X
is	X
a	X
lone	X
wolf	X
,	X
looking	X
out	X
only	X
for	X
itself	X
.	X

All	X
it	X
has	X
to	X
do	X
is	X
stun	X
its	X
attacker	X
and	X
make	X
a	X
getaway	X
.	X

Sure	X
,	X
every	X
so	X
often	X
it	X
's	X
an	X
unfortunate	X
human	X
on	X
the	X
receiving	X
end	X
of	X
that	X
stinger	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
tarantula	X
hawk	X
is	X
far	X
more	X
placid	X
than	X
it	X
may	X
let	X

that	X

happened	X
because	X

mainstream	X

because	X
of	X
infighting	X

because	X

from	X

it	X
was	X

a	X

spy	X
organization	X

has	X
been	X
spying	X
on	X
Amnesty	X
International	X

is	X
ironic	X

considering	X

UK	X
government	X
is	X
party	X
to	X
the	X
Wassenaar	X
Agreement	X
,	X

former	X

And	X
you	X
may	X
have	X
noticed	X
a	X
slight	X
anomaly	X
:	X
Tuesday	X
's	X
leap	X
second	X
caused	X
some	X
sporadic	X
outages	X
across	X
the	X
Internet	X
just	X
after	X
midnight	X
.	X

But	X
that	X
's	X
not	X
all	X
.	X

As	X
always	X
,	X
to	X
read	X
the	X
full	X
story	X

be	X
safe	X
out	X
there	X

the	X
more	X

Freedom	X
Act	X
may	X
have	X
signaled	X
an	X
end	X
to	X
the	X
Patriot	X
Act	X

bulk	X
collection	X
of	X
American	X
phone	X
records	X
,	X
but	X
not	X
so	X
fast	X
:	X
its	X
demise	X
will	X
be	X
postponed	X
for	X
a	X
bit	X

A	X
FISA	X
court	X
approved	X
the	X
government	X
's	X
request	X
to	X
renew	X
the	X

surveillance	X
program	X
for	X
what	X
is	X
to	X
be	X
a	X
six-month	X
transition	X
period	X
.	X

The	X
only	X
irony	X
is	X
that	X
the	X
program	X
already	X
shut	X
down	X
amidst	X
congressional	X
feedback	X
,	X
so	X
restating	X
it	X
after	X
its	X
lapse	X
seems	X
rather	X
sillybut	X
here	X
we	X
are	X
.	X

The	X
eventual	X
good	X
news	X
is	X
that	X
records	X
will	X
need	X
to	X
be	X
requested	X
from	X
phone	X
companies	X
on	X
an	X
as-needed	X
basis	X
,	X
and	X
with	X
permission	X
from	X
the	X
FISA	X
Court	X

this	X

Senator	X
Wyden	X
,	X
one	X
of	X
NSA	X
's	X
biggest	X
critics	X
,	X
said	X
it	X
best	X
:	X
"	X
This	X
illegal	X
dragnet	X
surveillance	X
violated	X
Americans'	X
rights	X
for	X
fourteen	X
years	X
without	X

our	X
country	X
any	X
safer	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
disappointing	X
that	X
the	X
administration	X
is	X
seeking	X
to	X
resurrect	X
this	X
unnecessary	X
and	X

program	X

On-demand	X

So	X
how	X
the	X

do	X
startups	X
make	X
sure	X
that	X

But	X
that	X
's	X
not	X
as	X
easy	X
as	X
scheduling	X

Most	X

the	X

the	X

they	X
're	X
supposedly	X

to	X
some	X

the	X

that	X
the	X
ride-hailing	X

Other	X
companies	X

that	X
operations	X
on	X

are	X
even	X
more	X

heavy	X

(	X

he	X

On	X
big	X
holidays	X
,	X
when	X
demand	X
is	X
high	X
,	X
that	X
spike	X
is	X
enough	X
to	X
incentivize	X
its	X
workforce	X
to	X
sign	X
up	X
for	X
a	X
shift	X
,	X
Vaughn	X
says	X
.	X

"	X
They	X
love	X
coming	X
on	X
the	X
system	X
because	X
we	X
get	X

many	X

Because	X
of	X
the	X
way	X
the	X

works	X

couriers	X
can	X
deliver	X
five	X

six	X

an	X
hour	X

he	X
says	X

pointing	X
out	X
that	X
since	X
the	X
business	X
is	X
based	X
on	X

just	X
one	X

of	X

's	X
easy	X
to	X
pick	X
up	X
a	X

of	X
orders	X
at	X

Without	X
such	X
built-in	X
advantages	X
,	X
Vaughn	X
says	X
,	X
on-demand	X
startups	X
would	X
likely	X
need	X
to	X
offer	X
its	X
employees	X
higher-than-normal	X

Indeed	X

about	X
half	X

The	X
1099	X
model	X

For	X
his	X

set	X
about	X

Boock	X
worked	X
with	X
musician	X
Matt	X
Fletcher	X
of	X
the	X
band	X
GEF	X
to	X
figure	X
out	X
how	X
to	X
design	X
contraptions	X
that	X
alter	X
music	X
in	X
the	X

way	X

Decades	X
before	X
Boock	X
came	X
up	X
with	X
his	X
colorful	X
structures	X
,	X
musicians	X
were	X
using	X
physical	X
tools	X
to	X
warp	X
and	X
modify	X
sounds	X

Boock	X
's	X
re-imagining	X
of	X
these	X
classic	X
tools	X
are	X
markedly	X
more	X
design-focused	X
.	X

His	X
reverb	X
device	X
,	X
for	X
example	X
,	X
is	X
a	X
bright	X
yellow	X
pyramid	X
structure	X
with	X
two	X
sets	X
of	X
coiled	X
springs	X
attached	X
to	X
it	X

Flick	X
or	X
knock	X
on	X
the	X
metal	X
stand	X
and	X
the	X
sound	X
travels	X
up	X
the	X
spring	X
,	X
is	X
collected	X
at	X
the	X
other	X
end	X
,	X
and	X
emits	X
a	X
vibrating	X
hum	X
.	X

Boock	X
says	X
he	X
first	X
tried	X
using	X
wood	X
and	X
Slinkies	X
.	X

It	X
did	X
n't	X
work	X
,	X
but	X
using	X
a	X
metal	X
frame	X
provided	X
the	X
"	X
industrial	X
"	X
sound	X
he	X
was	X
looking	X
forwhile	X
replicating	X
the	X
design	X
of	X
reverb	X
tanks	X
used	X
since	X
the	X
1940s	X
.	X

His	X
tremolo	X
piece	X
works	X
by	X
hooking	X
up	X
an	X
instrument	X
input	X
to	X
a	X
red	X
speaker	X
that	X
spins	X
like	X
a	X
weathervane	X
.	X

The	X
sound	X
is	X
fed	X
into	X
Boock	X
's	X
design	X
and	X
piped	X
out	X
of	X
this	X
rotating	X
hornlike	X
opening	X
.	X

As	X
it	X
spins	X
in	X
circles	X
,	X
our	X
ears	X
hear	X
the	X
sound	X
take	X
on	X
a	X
pulsating	X
effect	X
because	X
of	X
the	X
fluctuating	X
volume	X
levels	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
the	X
same	X
effect	X
speaker	X
builder	X
Donald	X
Leslie	X
pioneered	X
in	X
the	X
1930s	X
.	X

The	X
voice	X
modulation	X
design	X
shows	X
a	X
speaker	X
sitting	X
inside	X
an	X
airtight	X
cylinder	X
with	X
a	X
tube	X
snaking	X
out	X
of	X
it	X
.	X

The	X
sound	X
is	X
channeled	X
through	X
the	X
tube	X
and	X
into	X
the	X
musician	X
's	X
mouth	X
.	X

As	X
the	X
musician	X
moves	X
her	X
mouth	X
,	X
the	X
sound	X
is	X
modulated	X
,	X
creating	X
an	X

the	X
plane	X

the	X

the	X

Every	X

double	X

it	X
can	X
take	X
a	X
ridiculous	X
amount	X

can	X
continue	X
flying	X
if	X
it	X

an	X

half	X

And	X
,	X
because	X
the	X
A-10	X

role	X

it	X
's	X
designed	X
for	X

it	X
in	X

Entire	X
engines	X
can	X
be	X
quickly	X

easily	X
replaced	X

Most	X
repairs	X
can	X
even	X
be	X
made	X
in	X
the	X
field	X

parts	X
are	X
interchangeable	X
between	X
the	X
left	X
and	X
right	X
sides	X
of	X
the	X
plane	X

and	X
the	X
A-10	X
can	X
take	X
off	X
from	X
rough	X

unpaved	X
runways	X

Because	X
it	X
has	X
huge	X
wings	X
,	X
a	X
high	X
wing	X
aspect	X

huge	X
ailerons	X

What	X
makes	X
the	X

the	X

Sizable	X

storms	X
in	X
both	X

spectacular	X

a	X
much	X
larger	X
area	X

Earth	X

As	X
coveted	X

predicting	X
when	X

where	X
they	X
'll	X
be	X
visible	X

tough	X

the	X

the	X
satellite	X
sits	X
less	X
than	X
a	X
million	X
miles	X
from	X

scientists	X
get	X
very	X
little	X
warning	X

usually	X
no	X
more	X
than	X
an	X
hour	X

measuring	X

the	X

also	X
challenging	X

the	X

question	X
continues	X
to	X
come	X
up	X
:	X
How	X
unsafe	X
is	X
it	X
really	X
?	X

While	X
pyrotechnician	X
Mike	X
Tockstein	X
declined	X
to	X
offer	X
how	X
probable	X
it	X
was	X
for	X
a	X
drone	X
to	X
hit	X
a	X
firework	X
shell	X

shoot	X
down	X

victims	X
,	X
he	X
did	X
call	X
it	X
"	X
unlikely	X

"	X

He	X
says	X
you	X
should	X
probably	X
be	X
more	X
concerned	X
about	X
the	X
fate	X
of	X
your	X
UAV	X
.	X

"	X
It	X
is	X
more	X
likely	X
that	X
the	X
drone	X
could	X
get	X
hit	X
with	X
a	X
star	X
flying	X
out	X
of	X
the	X
exploding	X
shell	X
at	X
a	X
high	X
velocity	X
,"	X
he	X
says	X
.	X

"	X
The	X
closer	X
the	X
drone	X
is	X
to	X
the	X
point	X
at	X
which	X
the	X
fireworks	X
are	X
exploding	X
in	X
the	X
sky	X

the	X

the	X
probability	X

if	X

throw	X
caution	X
to	X
the	X
wind	X
(	X

,	X

your	X

says	X
that	X

that	X
the	X

When	X
a	X
planet	X
(	X

has	X
a	X
satellite	X

you	X
can	X
use	X
the	X
motion	X
of	X
that	X
object	X
to	X
find	X
the	X
mass	X
of	X
the	X
planet	X

It	X
's	X
not	X
too	X
difficult	X

In	X
fact	X

let	X
's	X
use	X
the	X

estimate	X
the	X
mass	X
of	X
Pluto	X

Ok	X

there	X
is	X
just	X
one	X
thing	X
we	X
need	X
that	X
's	X
not	X
in	X

.	X

We	X
need	X
to	X
know	X
the	X
distance	X
from	X
Charon	X
to	X
Pluto	X
.	X

Actually	X
,	X
if	X
I	X
knew	X
the	X
angular	X
field	X

,	X
for	X
this	X
example	X
I	X
will	X
just	X
look	X
up	X
this	X
value	X

use	X

Pluto	X

Charon	X

the	X

that	X

is	X

You	X
can	X
see	X
that	X
both	X

Charon	X
are	X
orbiting	X
a	X
common	X

*	X
We	X
are	X
not	X
viewing	X
the	X
orbit	X
from	X
a	X
completely	X
perpendicular	X
angle	X

This	X
means	X
that	X
Charon	X
does	X
n't	X
appear	X
to	X
move	X
in	X
a	X
circle	X
(	X
even	X
though	X
it	X
essentially	X
is	X

Basic	X
Physics	X

There	X
are	X
really	X
only	X
two	X
physics	X
principles	X
we	X
need	X
for	X
this	X
problemthe	X
gravitational	X
force	X
and	X
the	X
acceleration	X
of	X
an	X
object	X
moving	X
in	X
a	X
circle	X
.	X

Let	X
's	X
start	X
with	X
gravity	X
.	X

The	X
model	X
for	X
the	X
gravitational	X
interaction	X
says	X
that	X
there	X
is	X
an	X
attractive	X
for	X
pulling	X
on	X
objects	X
with	X
mass	X
.	X

The	X
magnitude	X
of	X
this	X
force	X
is	X
proportional	X
to	X
the	X
product	X
of	X
the	X
masses	X
of	X
the	X
two	X
objects	X
interacting	X
and	X
inversely	X
proportional	X
to	X
the	X
square	X
of	X
the	X
distance	X
between	X
the	X
objects	X
.	X

I	X
can	X
write	X
the	X
magnitude	X
of	X
this	X
force	X
as	X
:	X

La	X
te	X
xi	X
t	X
1	X

The	X
G	X
is	X
just	X
a	X
constant	X
,	X
so	X
do	X
n't	X
worry	X
about	X
that	X
.	X

But	X
there	X
is	X
one	X
more	X
thing	X
that	X
is	X
important	X
.	X

The	X
gravitational	X
force	X
is	X
always	X
pulling	X
the	X
two	X
objects	X
together	X
and	X
is	X
in	X
the	X
direction	X
of	X
the	X
other	X
object	X
.	X

The	X
other	X
important	X
idea	X
is	X
to	X
consider	X
the	X
acceleration	X
of	X
an	X
object	X
moving	X
in	X
a	X
circleyes	X
,	X
both	X
Pluto	X
and	X
Charon	X
are	X
moving	X
in	X
a	X
circle	X
about	X
a	X
common	X
center	X
.	X

Here	X
is	X
a	X
diagram	X
(	X
but	X
not	X
to	X
scale	X
)	X
.	X

Sketches	X
Spring	X
2015	X
key	X

Any	X
object	X
moving	X
in	X
a	X
circle	X
(	X
even	X
at	X
a	X
constant	X
speed	X
)	X
will	X
be	X
accelerating	X
.	X

The	X
direction	X
of	X
this	X
acceleration	X
will	X
be	X
pointed	X
towards	X
the	X
center	X
of	X
the	X
circle	X
and	X
it	X
will	X
have	X
a	X
magnitude	X
that	X
depends	X
on	X
both	X
the	X
angular	X
velocity	X
and	X
the	X
radius	X
of	X
the	X
circle	X
.	X

This	X
acceleration	X
can	X
be	X
written	X
as	X
:	X

La	X
te	X
xi	X
t	X
1	X

Here	X
the	X
is	X
the	X
angular	X
velocity	X
of	X
the	X
object	X
in	X
radians	X
per	X
second	X
.	X

But	X
I	X
guess	X
there	X
is	X
one	X
more	X
physics	X
thing	X
to	X
look	X
at	X
:	X
the	X
relationship	X
between	X
force	X
and	X
acceleration	X
.	X

Simply	X
,	X
the	X
greater	X
the	X
net	X
force	X
on	X
an	X
object	X
the	X
greater	X
the	X
acceleration	X
.	X

La	X
te	X
xi	X
t	X
1	X

Now	X
to	X
put	X
it	X
all	X
together	X
.	X

The	X
force	X
is	X
the	X
gravitational	X
force	X
and	X
the	X
acceleration	X
is	X
due	X
to	X
circular	X
motion	X
.	X

There	X
is	X
one	X
catch	X
.	X

If	X
I	X
write	X
this	X
out	X
for	X
the	X
motion	X
of	X
Charon	X
then	X
the	X
gravitational	X
force	X
will	X
use	X
the	X
distance	X
from	X
Charon	X
to	X
Pluto	X
but	X
the	X
acceleration	X
will	X
use	X
the	X
distance	X
from	X
Charon	X
to	X
the	X
center	X
of	X
rotational	X
motion	X
.	X

Just	X
to	X
be	X
clear	X
,	X
I	X
will	X
call	X
the	X
distance	X
between	X
the	X
objects	X
r	X
and	X
the	X
radius	X
of	X
Charon	X
's	X
circular	X
orbit	X
will	X
be	X
r	X
(	X
c	X
)	X
.	X

Also	X
,	X
since	X
the	X
gravitational	X
force	X
(	X
the	X
only	X
force	X
)	X
is	X
in	X
the	X
same	X

can	X
write	X
this	X
as	X
a	X
scalar	X
equation	X
.	X

La	X

xi	X
t	X

The	X
mass	X
of	X
Charon	X
cancels	X
and	X
so	X
I	X
can	X
solve	X
for	X
the	X
mass	X
of	X
Pluto	X
.	X

La	X

So	X
all	X
I	X
need	X
are	X
the	X
two	X
distances	X
and	X
the	X
angular	X
speed	X
of	X
Charon	X
's	X
orbit	X
.	X

Finding	X
Values	X

I	X
already	X
said	X
that	X
I	X
was	X
going	X
to	X
look	X
up	X
the	X
distance	X
from	X
Pluto	X
to	X
Charon	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
I	X
need	X
the	X
distance	X
from	X
Charon	X
to	X
the	X
center	X
of	X
the	X
orbital	X
circle	X
.	X

By	X
skipping	X
through	X
the	X
frames	X
of	X
the	X
animation	X
,	X
I	X
can	X
find	X
the	X
one	X
that	X
shows	X
Charon	X
and	X
Pluto	X
the	X
furthest	X
apartit	X
's	X
at	X
this	X
point	X
that	X
I	X
can	X
see	X
the	X
full	X
size	X
of	X
the	X
orbit	X
(	X
no	X
perspective	X
)	X
.	X

Using	X
this	X
image	X
and	X
the	X
distance	X
from	X
Pluto	X
to	X
Charon	X
,	X
I	X
get	X
a	X
circular	X
orbit	X
radius	X
of	X
1.69	X
x	X
10	X
^	X
7	X
m	X
.	X

Now	X
I	X
just	X
need	X
the	X
angular	X
velocity	X
of	X
the	X
orbit	X
.	X

If	X
I	X
pick	X
a	X
frame	X
with	X
Charon	X
almost	X
above	X
Pluto	X
and	X
then	X
when	X
it	X
is	X
almost	X
below	X
it	X
,	X
that	X
would	X
be	X
half	X
an	X
orbit	X
.	X

Looking	X
at	X
the	X
time	X
stamps	X
on	X
each	X
frame	X
,	X
this	X
would	X
give	X
a	X
time	X
of	X
about	X
3.2	X
days	X
(	X
276,480	X
seconds	X
)	X
.	X

That	X
would	X
put	X
the	X
angular	X
velocity	X
as	X
:	X

I	X
can	X
put	X

all	X
my	X
values	X
to	X
calculate	X
the	X

Crunching	X
the	X
numbers	X

I	X
get	X
a	X

1.24	X

is	X
pretty	X

According	X

look	X

It	X
's	X
called	X
the	X
SE200	X

Chlorine	X

uses	X
technology	X
developed	X
by	X
the	X
military	X
for	X
water	X
purification	X
in	X
remote	X
areas	X

Current	X
water-filtering	X

is	X
costly	X

MIT	X

are	X
testing	X
a	X
simpler	X

cheaper	X
method	X
that	X

Chlorine	X
is	X
commonly	X
used	X
to	X
disinfect	X
water	X
because	X
it	X
kills	X
many	X

The	X
problem	X
is	X
,	X
though	X
,	X
chlorine	X

n't	X

easy	X
to	X

And	X
it	X
's	X

Last	X
week	X

I	X
got	X
a	X
chance	X
to	X
see	X
the	X
SE200	X
in	X
action	X
,	X
at	X
a	X
world	X
development	X
conference	X
in	X
the	X
District	X
of	X
Columbia	X
.	X

The	X
device	X
is	X
a	X
small	X
plastic	X
canister	X
that	X
attaches	X
to	X
a	X
battery	X
with	X
what	X
look	X
like	X
miniature	X
jumper	X
cables	X
.	X

Using	X
a	X
special	X
"	X
brine	X
bottle	X
,"	X
you	X
add	X
salt	X
and	X
water	X
in	X
amounts	X
indicated	X
by	X
lines	X
.	X

Mix	X
it	X
up	X
,	X
and	X
add	X
the	X
salt	X
solution	X
to	X
the	X
SE200	X
.	X

With	X
the	X
push	X
of	X
a	X
button	X
,	X
the	X
canister	X
illuminates	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
solution	X
begins	X
to	X
bubble	X

What	X
looks	X
like	X
boiling	X
water	X
is	X
actually	X
a	X
chemical	X
reaction	X
,	X
called	X
electrolysis	X
,	X
says	X
Jesse	X
Schubert	X
,	X
of	X
the	X
NGO	X
PATH	X
.	X

In	X
water	X
,	X
the	X
salt	X
(	X
i.e.	X
,	X
sodium	X
chloride	X
)	X
breaks	X
apart	X
into	X
sodium	X
and	X
chlorine	X
ions	X
.	X

The	X
electricity	X
from	X
the	X
battery	X
separates	X
the	X
negatively	X
charged	X
ions	X
from	X
the	X
positively	X
charged	X
ions	X
.	X

The	X
reaction	X
releases	X
gas	X

and	X
creates	X
bleach	X
,	X
or	X
sodium	X
hypochlorite	X
.	X

"	X
There	X
are	X
other	X
chlorine	X
generators	X
out	X
there	X

Schubert	X
says	X
.	X

But	X
they	X
can	X
be	X
expensive	X
and	X
difficult	X
to	X
use	X
.	X

"	X
The	X
innovation	X
(	X
of	X
the	X
SE200	X
)	X
is	X
that	X
the	X
unique	X
circuitry	X

always	X
makes	X

chlorine	X
concentration	X

One	X
teaspoon	X
of	X

treat	X
5	X

developing	X

Then	X
PATH	X

into	X
a	X

Each	X
device	X
costs	X
about	X

200	X

But	X
it	X
can	X
treat	X
enough	X
water	X
for	X
200	X
people	X
for	X
about	X
five	X
years	X

incongruous	X

this	X

fully	X

there	X

It	X
's	X
hard	X
to	X
say	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
because	X
the	X
effects	X
of	X
a	X

can	X
extend	X
to	X

out	X
a	X
review	X
of	X
the	X
West	X

for	X
the	X

there	X
were	X
many	X
ways	X
laws	X
applying	X
only	X

England	X

,	X
could	X
still	X
have	X
"	X
consequential	X
effects	X
"	X
in	X
the	X
devolved	X
nations	X
.	X

For	X
example	X
,	X
there	X
is	X
a	X
tradition	X
of	X
"	X
parity	X
"	X
between	X
a	X
devolved	X
administration	X
and	X
Westminster	X
in	X
some	X
policy	X
areas	X

There	X
are	X

a	X

take	X
into	X
account	X

public	X

in	X
England	X

This	X
is	X
often	X
controversial	X
,	X
for	X
example	X
when	X
spending	X
on	X
the	X
London	X
Olympics	X
was	X
deemed	X
to	X
be	X
UK-wide	X
,	X
rather	X
than	X
England-only	X
-	X
triggering	X
a	X
row	X
between	X
Westminster	X

the	X
devolved	X

For	X
these	X
reasons	X
,	X
according	X
to	X
House	X

it	X
is	X
"	X
not	X
a	X

to	X
count	X
England-only	X

However	X
,	X
it	X
adds	X
that	X
"	X
whatever	X
method	X

there	X
are	X
relatively	X
few	X
bills	X
that	X
unambiguously	X
affect	X
England	X
only	X

That	X
's	X
not	X
the	X
end	X
of	X
the	X
matter	X
though	X

There	X
could	X
be	X
sections	X
of	X
a	X
bill	X
that	X
apply	X
only	X
in	X
England	X

even	X
when	X
the	X

itself	X
extends	X
across	X
the	X
United	X

The	X

it	X
will	X

Does	X
the	X
world	X

change	X

When	X
asked	X
what	X
would	X
persuade	X
him	X
to	X
pay	X
for	X
music	X

Barrett	X
could	X
n't	X
think	X

anything	X

He	X
joins	X
the	X
majority	X

Americans	X

most	X
of	X
whom	X
have	X
actually	X
tried	X

according	X

a	X

that	X

charge	X

Another	X
10	X

say	X
they	X
might	X
be	X
willing	X
to	X
pay	X
if	X
given	X
a	X
reason	X

Dave	X

"	X

Swift	X
wo	X
n't	X
put	X

she	X
says	X
its	X
free	X
ad-supported	X

does	X
n't	X
pay	X
enough	X

Apple	X
planned	X
to	X
launch	X
its	X
service	X
without	X
paying	X

for	X
the	X
music	X
during	X
the	X
three-month	X

would	X
n't	X
put	X
her	X
music	X
on	X

changed	X

got	X
Swift	X
's	X
hit	X
album	X
1989	X

Spotify	X
does	X
n't	X
.	X

Apple	X
's	X
got	X
another	X
advantage	X

it	X
enters	X

nearly	X
half	X

a	X

so	X
she	X
wants	X
them	X
to	X
get	X
paid	X

That	X
's	X
why	X
she	X
became	X
a	X
Spotify	X
subscriber	X

But	X
she	X
says	X
she	X
might	X
consider	X
making	X
the	X
switch	X
to	X
Apple	X

"	X
If	X
Apple	X
's	X

better	X

would	X
probably	X

more	X
likely	X

go	X
with	X
them	X

Gonzales	X
says	X

"	X
It	X
would	X
be	X
easier	X
to	X
move	X

just	X

That	X

room	X
for	X
more	X

one	X
streaming	X

and	X
consumer	X
choice	X
may	X
be	X
about	X

Though	X
ultimately	X
it	X

boils	X
down	X
to	X
getting	X

to	X
pay	X
for	X
something	X

HOST	X
:	X

Sunday	X
's	X
failure	X
of	X
a	X
Falcon	X
9	X
rocket	X
launched	X
from	X
Cape	X
Canaveral	X
broke	X
the	X
winning	X
streak	X
of	X
SpaceX	X
,	X
Elon	X
Musk	X
's	X
private	X
space	X
company	X
.	X

SpaceX	X
had	X
been	X
18-for-18	X
with	X
Falcon	X
9	X
launches	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
rocket	X
,	X
loaded	X
with	X
supplies	X
for	X
the	X
International	X
Space	X
Station	X
,	X
disintegrated	X
just	X
over	X
two	X
minutes	X
after	X
launch	X
,	X
which	X
raises	X
a	X
question	X
.	X

When	X
a	X
government	X
rocket	X
explodes	X
after	X
launch	X
,	X
the	X
government	X
absorbs	X
the	X
cost	X
and	X
the	X
government	X
goes	X
on	X
.	X

What	X
about	X
a	X
private	X
rocket	X
launch	X
?	X

Who	X
absorbs	X
that	X
cost	X
,	X
and	X
can	X
the	X
company	X
's	X
business	X
plan	X
go	X
on	X
?	X

Well	X

My	X

SIEGEL	X
:	X
Is	X
SpaceX	X
about	X
to	X
make	X
a	X
huge	X
insurance	X
claim	X
?	X

PASZTOR	X
:	X
Not	X
on	X
this	X
launch	X
,	X
for	X
sure	X
.	X

This	X
was	X
a	X
government	X
payload	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
government	X
,	X
as	X
you	X
very	X
well	X
said	X
it	X
,	X
is	X
responsible	X
for	X
the	X
loss	X
.	X

The	X
significant	X
issue	X
facing	X
SpaceX	X
goes	X
much	X
beyond	X
just	X
finding	X
out	X
what	X
happened	X
to	X
this	X
particular	X
rocket	X
and	X
what	X
the	X
cause	X
was	X
and	X
fixing	X
it	X
.	X

They	X
have	X
been	X
trying	X
to	X
ramp	X
up	X
their	X
launch	X
rate	X
.	X

They	X
've	X
been	X
trying	X
to	X
show	X
that	X
they	X
can	X
move	X
into	X
a	X
much	X
higher	X
launch	X
rate	X
than	X
almost	X
anybody	X
in	X
the	X
industry	X
.	X

And	X
this	X
accident	X
has	X
got	X
to	X
hurt	X
them	X
,	X
both	X
from	X
a	X
morale	X
standpoint	X
,	X
but	X
more	X
significantly	X
,	X
it	X
'll	X
slow	X
them	X
down	X
,	X
and	X
it	X
'll	X
put	X
their	X
huge	X
backlog	X
-	X
push	X
it	X
out	X
even	X
further	X
.	X

SIEGEL	X
:	X
But	X
you	X
say	X
that	X
because	X
this	X
was	X
a	X
government	X
payload	X
headed	X
for	X
the	X
International	X
Space	X
Station	X
that	X
,	X
in	X
fact	X
,	X
the	X
government	X
will	X
absorb	X
the	X
cost	X
of	X
this	X
loss	X
.	X

What	X
exactly	X
was	X
private	X
about	X
this	X
particular	X
rocket	X
launch	X
?	X

PASZTOR	X
:	X
The	X
private	X
part	X
was	X
the	X
actual	X
launch	X
itself	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
a	X
service	X
purchased	X
by	X
the	X
government	X
from	X
SpaceX	X
.	X

SpaceX	X
gets	X
paid	X
for	X
delivering	X
so	X
many	X
pounds	X
to	X
the	X
space	X
station	X
,	X
and	X
that	X
's	X
it	X
.	X

So	X
the	X
cost	X
to	X
the	X
government	X
,	X
of	X
course	X
,	X
is	X
what	X
was	X
lost	X
on	X
the	X
rocket	X
,	X
which	X
is	X
food	X
and	X
all	X
sorts	X
of	X
other	X
cargo	X
materials	X
and	X
a	X
part	X
of	X
a	X
docking	X
system	X
for	X
future	X
commercial	X
manned	X
launches	X
to	X
the	X
space	X
station	X
.	X

But	X
the	X
cost	X
of	X
what	X
was	X
lost	X
pales	X
next	X
to	X
what	X
the	X
potential	X
costs	X
are	X
for	X
SpaceX	X
if	X
it	X
ca	X
n't	X
show	X
that	X
it	X
's	X
able	X
to	X
get	X
over	X
this	X
and	X
really	X
continue	X
to	X
launch	X
at	X
the	X
rate	X
that	X
it	X
has	X
promised	X
.	X

SIEGEL	X
:	X
If	X
there	X
had	X
been	X
people	X
aboard	X
that	X
rocket	X
headed	X
for	X
the	X
space	X
station	X
,	X
I	X
think	X
the	X
coverage	X
would	X
be	X
very	X
different	X
-	X
a	X
lot	X
bigger	X
than	X
it	X
has	X
been	X
.	X

Does	X
this	X
sort	X
of	X
thing	X
set	X
back	X
the	X
whole	X
idea	X
of	X
being	X
a	X
commercial	X
manned	X
space	X
company	X
?	X

PASZTOR	X
:	X
Well	X
,	X
I	X
think	X
it	X
'll	X
certainly	X
prompt	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
debate	X
about	X
it	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
U.S.	X
,	X
for	X
sure	X
,	X
is	X
far	X
down	X
that	X
path	X
.	X

We	X
do	X
n't	X
have	X
any	X
other	X
way	X
to	X
get	X
to	X
the	X
space	X
station	X
at	X
this	X
point	X
,	X
with	X
cargo	X
or	X
with	X
crews	X
,	X
other	X
than	X
these	X
commercial	X
operators	X
.	X

Boeing	X
and	X
SpaceX	X
are	X
in	X
line	X
to	X
start	X
sending	X
up	X
NASA	X
astronauts	X
starting	X
in	X
2017	X
,	X
if	X
everything	X
works	X
well	X
,	X
so	X
there	X
'll	X
be	X
lots	X
of	X
debate	X
.	X

There	X
'll	X
probably	X
be	X
lots	X
of	X
handwringing	X
,	X
but	X
,	X
in	X
fact	X
,	X
there	X
is	X
no	X
other	X
choice	X
.	X

There	X
's	X
no	X
way	X
to	X
turn	X
back	X
.	X

SIEGEL	X
:	X
And	X
in	X
the	X
-	X
in	X
the	X
relatively	X
small	X
field	X
of	X
companies	X
that	X
are	X
privately	X
launching	X
rockets	X
,	X
how	X
is	X
SpaceX	X
doing	X
compared	X
to	X
the	X
competition	X
?	X

PASZTOR	X
:	X
Well	X
,	X
even	X
with	X
the	X
failure	X
on	X
Sunday	X
,	X
they	X
're	X
far	X
ahead	X
of	X
anybody	X
else	X
in	X
this	X
small	X
but	X
growing	X
arena	X
.	X

They	X
have	X
notched	X
many	X
firsts	X
,	X
including	X
the	X
first	X
private	X
entity	X
to	X
orbit	X
a	X
spacecraft	X
around	X
the	X
Earth	X
.	X

And	X
they	X
're	X
far	X
ahead	X
,	X
both	X
in	X
terms	X
of	X
technical	X
achievements	X
and	X
commercial	X
success	X
.	X

They	X
have	X
a	X
$	X
7	X
billion	X
-	X
that	X
's	X
B	X
as	X
in	X
billion	X
dollar	X
-	X
backlog	X
and	X
so	X
they	X
have	X
lots	X
of	X
business	X
.	X

The	X
question	X
is	X
,	X
can	X
they	X
can	X
deliver	X
on	X
those	X
promises	X
,	X
those	X
contracts	X
,	X
in	X
time	X
to	X
satisfy	X
their	X
customers	X
?	X

A	X
doctor	X
I	X
interviewed	X
for	X
this	X
story	X
told	X
me	X
something	X
that	X
stuck	X
with	X
me	X
.	X

He	X
said	X
for	X
every	X
person	X
with	X
dementia	X
he	X
treats	X
,	X
he	X
finds	X
himself	X
caring	X
for	X
two	X
patients	X
.	X

That	X
's	X
how	X
hard	X
it	X
can	X
be	X
to	X
be	X
a	X
caregiver	X
for	X
someone	X
with	X
dementia	X
.	X

The	X
doctor	X
is	X
Bruce	X
Miller	X
.	X

He	X
directs	X
the	X
Memory	X
and	X
Aging	X
Center	X
at	X
the	X
University	X
of	X
California	X
,	X
San	X
Francisco	X
.	X

According	X
to	X
Miller	X
,	X
50	X
percent	X
of	X
caregivers	X
develop	X
a	X
major	X
depressive	X
illness	X
because	X
of	X
the	X
caregiving	X
.	X

"	X
The	X
caregiver	X
is	X
so	X
overburdened	X
that	X
they	X
do	X
n't	X
know	X
what	X
to	X
do	X
next	X
,"	X
he	X
says	X
.	X

"	X
This	X
adds	X
a	X
huge	X
burden	X
to	X
the	X
medical	X
system	X
.	X
"	X

This	X
burden	X
is	X
going	X
increase	X
dramatically	X
in	X
the	X
coming	X
decade	X
.	X

By	X
2025	X
,	X
7	X
million	X
Americans	X
will	X
have	X
Alzheimer	X
's	X
disease	X
,	X
according	X
to	X
one	X
recent	X
estimate	X
.	X

Millions	X
more	X
will	X
suffer	X
from	X
other	X
types	X
of	X
dementia	X
.	X

Together	X
these	X
diseases	X
may	X
become	X
the	X
most	X
expensive	X
segment	X
of	X
the	X
so-called	X
"	X
silver	X
tsunami	X
"	X
80	X
million	X
baby	X
boomers	X
who	X
are	X
getting	X
older	X
and	X
needing	X
more	X
medical	X
care	X
.	X

The	X
cost	X
of	X
caring	X
for	X
Alzheimer	X
's	X
patients	X
alone	X
is	X
expected	X
to	X
triple	X
by	X
2050	X

to	X
more	X
than	X
$	X
1	X

Researchers	X

dementia	X
patients	X
and	X
to	X
ease	X
the	X
strain	X
on	X
caregivers	X

That	X
includes	X
caregivers	X
like	X
Maria	X
Martinez	X
,	X
42	X
,	X
who	X
visits	X
her	X
parents'	X
small	X
apartment	X
in	X
San	X
Rafael	X
,	X
Calif.	X
,	X
almost	X
daily	X

her	X
mom	X
,	X
Aurora	X
Martinez	X

who	X

Maria	X
Martinez	X
is	X
an	X
only	X
child	X
with	X
a	X
partner	X
and	X
a	X
full-time	X
job	X
as	X
an	X
occupational	X
therapist	X
.	X

But	X
nearly	X
every	X
day	X
she	X
spends	X
at	X
least	X
a	X
couple	X
of	X
hours	X
with	X
her	X
parents	X
,	X
managing	X
a	X
long	X
list	X
of	X
responsibilities	X
that	X
are	X
critical	X

their	X
ability	X

live	X
independently	X

"	X
Does	X
she	X
have	X
a	X

She	X
bathes	X
her	X
mother	X
,	X
who	X
is	X
78	X
,	X
manages	X
upkeep	X
on	X
the	X
apartment	X
,	X
does	X
much	X
of	X
the	X
shopping	X
and	X
fills	X
prescriptions	X
for	X
both	X
of	X
her	X
parents	X
.	X

Especially	X
in	X
the	X
early	X
stages	X
of	X
Aurora	X
's	X
illness	X
,	X
practical	X
concerns	X
loomed	X
large	X
.	X

Sometimes	X
she	X
would	X
wander	X
in	X
the	X
middle	X
of	X
night	X
.	X

Her	X
husband	X
,	X
Arturo	X
Martinez	X
,	X
75	X
,	X
took	X
to	X
sleeping	X
on	X
the	X
floor	X
in	X
front	X
of	X
the	X
door	X
,	X
worried	X
Aurora	X
might	X
end	X
up	X
falling	X
in	X
the	X
street	X
and	X
being	X
hit	X
by	X
a	X
car	X
.	X

Eventually	X
,	X
Martinez	X
installed	X
a	X
lock	X
at	X
the	X
top	X
of	X
the	X
door	X
where	X
Aurora	X
could	X
n't	X
reach	X
it	X
,	X
and	X
a	X
wind	X
chime	X
to	X
serve	X
as	X
an	X
alarm	X
.	X

Though	X
the	X
Martinezes	X
are	X
not	X
part	X
of	X
the	X
study	X
,	X
they	X
are	X
the	X
kind	X
of	X
family	X
that	X
the	X
dementia	X
ecosystem	X
study	X
is	X
designed	X
to	X
help	X
.	X

The	X
study	X
will	X
enroll	X
2,100	X
patients	X
at	X
the	X
two	X
sites	X
.	X

Each	X
patient	X
will	X
have	X
a	X
navigator	X
,	X
a	X
nonmedical	X
staff	X
person	X
who	X
will	X
coordinate	X
care	X
and	X
triage	X
calls	X
,	X
so	X
minor	X
issues	X
do	X
n't	X
land	X
patients	X
in	X
the	X
ER	X
.	X

Some	X
patients	X
will	X
also	X
receive	X
activity	X
trackers	X
and	X
sensors	X
,	X
which	X
will	X
be	X
placed	X
around	X
the	X
house	X
or	X
worn	X
on	X
the	X
patient	X
's	X
wrist	X
.	X

Much	X
like	X
Martinez	X
's	X
wind	X
chimes	X
,	X
the	X
idea	X
is	X
to	X
see	X
whether	X
sensors	X
can	X
detect	X
when	X
a	X
patient	X
is	X
wandering	X
off	X
or	X
if	X
they	X
've	X
been	X
inactive	X
for	X
too	X
long	X

be	X
applied	X
to	X

COURTESY	X
OF	X
ZIZZLE	X

The	X
people	X
who	X
brought	X
you	X
the	X
weird	X
music	X
alien	X
iZ	X
have	X
come	X
out	X
with	X
another	X
equally	X
alien	X
device	X
,	X
called	X
Zoundz	X
.	X

It	X
looks	X
like	X
the	X
sort	X
of	X
leisure	X
device	X
Captain	X
Kirk	X
might	X
encounter	X
in	X
a	X
martian	X
boudoir	X
,	X
a	X
shiny	X
white	X
puddle	X
with	X
colorful	X
,	X
crazy-shaped	X
blocks	X
and	X
blinking	X
lights	X
.	X

You	X
move	X
the	X
blocks	X
to	X
create	X
and	X
manipulate	X
the	X
music	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
lights	X
lock	X
in	X
step	X
.	X

Six	X
of	X
the	X
blocks	X
have	X
sound	X
sequences	X
built	X
instring	X
,	X
keyboard	X
,	X
percussion	X
,	X
etc	X
.	X

The	X
seventh	X
block	X
is	X
for	X
recording	X
your	X
own	X
five	X
seconds	X
of	X
audio	X
.	X

By	X
moving	X
the	X
music	X
blocks	X
around	X
on	X
the	X
three	X
light	X
patches	X
,	X
you	X
can	X
make	X
thousands	X
of	X
different	X
sound	X
combinations	X
.	X

If	X
youve	X
got	X
rhythm	X
,	X
you	X
can	X
DJ	X
it	X
up	X
a	X
little	X
,	X
switching	X
blocks	X
around	X
to	X
alternate	X
effects	X
.	X

The	X
upside	X
to	X
Zoundz	X
is	X
that	X
it	X
is	X
sure	X
to	X
please	X
any	X
musically	X
inclined	X
person	X
;	X
the	X
downside	X
is	X
that	X
I	X
dont	X
know	X
how	X
long	X
that	X
pleasure	X
is	X
bound	X
to	X
last	X
.	X

The	X
sound	X
quality	X
isnt	X
great	X
(	X
you	X
can	X
plug	X
in	X
an	X
MP3	X
player	X
,	X
but	X
Im	X
not	X
sure	X
you	X
would	X
want	X
to	X
)	X
.	X

Once	X
the	X
initial	X
charm	X
wears	X
off	X
,	X
it	X
has	X
a	X
talking	X
clock	X
and	X
alarm	X
feature	X
that	X
might	X
come	X
in	X
handy	X
.	X

Buy	X
this	X
to	X
win	X
originality	X
points	X
,	X
or	X
to	X
please	X
the	X
person	X
on	X
your	X
list	X
who	X
delights	X
in	X
musical	X
toys	X
or	X
psychedelic	X
bric-a-brac	X

Brushing	X
to	X
the	X
Beat	X

My	X
dentist	X
once	X
told	X
me	X
that	X
the	X
real	X
benefit	X
of	X
the	X
new	X
Sonicare	X
toothbrush	X
craze	X
is	X
not	X
the	X
action	X
so	X
much	X
as	X
the	X
time	X
:	X
Sonicares	X
make	X
you	X
brush	X
for	X
two	X
full	X
minutes	X
.	X

If	X
the	X
two-minute	X
timer	X
is	X
the	X
real	X
key	X
to	X
healthy	X
teeth	X
,	X
ToothTunes	X
may	X
just	X
be	X
the	X
key	X
to	X
getting	X
kids	X
to	X
care	X
.	X

Coming	X
from	X
an	X
unlikely	X
manufacturerHasbros	X
Tiger	X
Electronics	X
divisionTooth	X
Tunes	X
broadcasts	X
two	X
minutes	X
of	X
music	X
straight	X
into	X
your	X
head	X
using	X
something	X
called	X
dentomandibular	X
bone	X
conduction	X
.	X

The	X
experience	X
is	X
fascinating	X
;	X
a	X
tech	X
watcher	X
like	X
me	X
sees	X
it	X
as	X
proof	X
that	X
the	X
next	X
handsfree	X
Bluetooth	X
devices	X
for	X
our	X
phones	X
will	X
be	X
carried	X
not	X
on	X
our	X
ears	X
,	X
but	X
in	X
our	X
mouths	X
.	X

Your	X
kid	X
will	X
probably	X
find	X
Tooth	X
Tunes	X
to	X
be	X
a	X
thrill	X
,	X
but	X
there	X
are	X
a	X
few	X
issues	X
:	X
the	X
best	X
way	X
to	X
listen	X
to	X
the	X
song	X
is	X
by	X
holding	X
the	X
brush	X
still	X
between	X
your	X
teeth	X
,	X
and	X
each	X
brush	X
only	X
comes	X
with	X
one	X
song	X
.	X

Mine	X
was	X
the	X
Rocky	X
theme	X
,	X
and	X
other	X
material	X
ranges	X
from	X
Hilary	X
Duff	X
to	X
Queen	X
,	X
but	X
you	X
may	X
want	X
to	X
plan	X
ahead	X
and	X
buy	X
a	X
few	X
to	X
keep	X
around	X
.	X

Theyll	X
be	X
on	X
sale	X
in	X
stores	X
next	X
year	X
,	X
but	X
you	X
can	X

ages	X

;	X
he	X
jokingly	X
called	X
it	X
a	X
threat	X
because	X
it	X
teaches	X
kids	X
English	X
and	X
Spanish	X
.	X

Theres	X
another	X

My	X
favorite	X
toddler	X
toy	X
this	X
year	X
is	X
the	X
Little	X
Leaps	X
Grow-With-Me	X
Learning	X
System	X
($	X
40	X
)	X
.	X

I	X
like	X
it	X
because	X
it	X
keeps	X
cost	X
down	X
by	X
leveraging	X
what	X
you	X
already	X
have	X
:	X
it	X
looks	X
like	X
a	X
game	X
console	X
,	X
but	X
its	X
really	X
a	X
universal	X
remote	X
that	X
controls	X
its	X
own	X
educational	X
DVD	X
games	X
that	X
you	X
play	X
on	X
your	X
DVD	X
player	X
.	X

Theres	X
a	X
bit	X
of	X
set-upyou	X
have	X
to	X
teach	X
the	X
system	X
what	X
DVD	X
player	X
you	X
havebut	X
once	X
you	X
do	X
,	X
the	X
remote	X
will	X
work	X
just	X
fine	X
.	X

Cooler	X
still	X
is	X
the	X
fact	X
that	X
the	X
controller	X
has	X
two	X
faces	X
,	X
a	X
chunky	X
,	X
button-based	X
one	X
for	X
babies	X
9	X
months	X
or	X
older	X
,	X
and	X
another	X
one	X
,	X
with	X
a	X
joystick	X
,	X
for	X
toddlers	X
2	X
years	X
and	X
up	X
.	X

You	X
just	X
flip	X
it	X
over	X
when	X
your	X
kid	X
grows	X
up	X
,	X
hence	X
the	X
grow-with-me	X
name	X
.	X

(	X
Obviously	X
,	X
its	X
just	X
as	X
useful	X
if	X
you	X
already	X
have	X
one	X
or	X
more	X
kids	X
in	X
both	X
age	X
groups	X
.	X
)	X

The	X
videos	X
are	X
surprisingly	X
interactive	X
,	X
working	X
on	X
language	X
development	X
,	X
number	X
concepts	X
,	X
problem	X
solving	X
and	X
more	X
.	X

Just	X
remember	X
this	X
:	X
since	X
the	X
Grow-With-Me	X
system	X
is	X
,	X
in	X
essence	X
,	X
a	X
second	X

remote	X
,	X
make	X
sure	X
its	X
out	X
of	X
reach	X
during	X
movie	X
night	X

else	X
your	X

might	X
accidentally	X
fast	X

COURTESY	X
OF	X
NIKON	X

I	X
am	X
not	X
a	X
professional	X
photographer	X
,	X
nor	X
am	X
I	X
a	X
devoted	X
hobbyist	X
,	X
but	X
I	X
do	X
like	X
to	X
take	X
good	X
pictures	X
.	X

Digital	X
SLR	X
cameras	X
resemble	X
older	X
single	X
lens	X
reflex	X
film	X
cameras	X
in	X
form	X
and	X
function	X
but	X
do	X
n't	X
mind	X
if	X
you	X
shoot	X
mostly	X
in	X
"	X
auto	X
,"	X
that	X
is	X
to	X
say	X
,	X
"	X
idiot	X
"	X
mode	X
,	X
so	X
I	X
like	X
them	X
a	X
lot	X
.	X

I	X
have	X
always	X
been	X
partial	X
to	X
Nikon	X
's	X
DSLRs	X
.	X

This	X
summer	X
,	X
when	X
I	X
studied	X
the	X
market	X
,	X
the	X
Nikons	X
shot	X
better	X
than	X
Olympus'	X
E-Volt	X
line	X
,	X
and	X
were	X
priced	X
comfortably	X
below	X
the	X
equally	X
good	X
Canon	X
Digital	X
Rebel	X
.	X

Nikon	X
's	X
big	X
news	X
this	X
year	X
was	X
the	X
D80	X
,	X
a	X
bit	X
too	X
high-end	X
for	X
beginners	X
.	X

But	X
now	X
the	X
company	X
is	X
addressing	X
beginners	X
directly	X
with	X
the	X
introduction	X
of	X
the	X
$	X
600	X
D40	X
.	X

The	X
question	X
on	X
the	X
minds	X
of	X
holiday	X
shoppers	X
:	X
how	X
does	X
the	X
new	X
D40	X
compare	X
to	X
Nikon	X
's	X
current	X
great	X
deal	X
,	X
the	X
D50	X
?	X

Both	X
are	X
6-megapixel	X
cameras	X
that	X
shoot	X
a	X
speedy	X
two	X
and	X
a	X
half	X
frames	X
per	X
second	X
,	X
and	X
use	X
only	X
SD	X
memory	X
cards	X
.	X

Both	X
come	X
with	X
lenses	X
(	X
for	X
$	X
100	X
more	X
,	X
the	X
D50	X
also	X
comes	X
with	X
an	X
18-55mm	X
starter	X
zoom	X
lens	X
)	X
.	X

Both	X
are	X
compatible	X
with	X
many	X
of	X
Nikon	X
's	X
pricier	X
pro	X
lenses	X
as	X
well	X
.	X

The	X
D50	X
has	X
two	X
LCD	X
screens	X
.	X

One	X
is	X
a	X
two-inch	X
,	X
130,000-pixel	X
,	X
color	X
display	X
for	X
reviewing	X
shots	X
and	X
viewing	X
menu	X
options	X
.	X

The	X
other	X
is	X
a	X
little	X
always-on	X
monochrome	X
display	X
that	X
shares	X
quick	X
facts	X
,	X
like	X
your	X
flash	X
setting	X
or	X
the	X
number	X
of	X
shots	X
remaining	X
on	X
your	X
memory	X
card	X
.	X

The	X
D40	X
has	X
just	X
one	X
LCD	X
,	X
a	X
larger	X
2.5-inch	X
,	X
230,000-pixel	X
screen	X
.	X

For	X
a	X
seasoned	X
shooter	X
,	X
the	X
D50	X
's	X
extra	X
screen	X
is	X
a	X
benefit	X
,	X
because	X
it	X
means	X
he	X
or	X
she	X
can	X
make	X
on-the-fly	X
adjustments	X
without	X
firing	X
up	X
the	X
bright	X
main	X
LCD	X
.	X

The	X
fact	X
that	X
the	X
D40	X
does	X
n't	X
have	X
the	X
extra	X
screen	X
is	X
just	X
the	X
first	X
indication	X
that	X
it	X
really	X
is	X
geared	X
toward	X
novices	X
,	X
far	X
more	X
than	X
its	X
predecessor	X
.	X

The	X
D40	X
is	X
a	X
teacher	X
.	X

One	X
of	X
its	X
most	X
fascinating	X
attributes	X
is	X
the	X
Info	X
screen	X
,	X
which	X
appears	X
at	X
the	X
touch	X
of	X
a	X
button	X
,	X
appropriately	X
marked	X
"	X
Info	X
.	X
"	X

The	X
screen	X
contains	X
all	X
sorts	X
of	X
data	X
,	X
mostly	X
photographic	X
mumbo	X
jumbo	X
.	X

But	X
the	X
screen	X
also	X
has	X
a	X
visual	X
representation	X
of	X
that	X
mumbo	X
jumbo	X
,	X
so	X
you	X
can	X
figure	X
out	X
what	X
it	X
means	X
.	X

For	X
instance	X
,	X
as	X
the	X
number	X
next	X
to	X
the	X
letter	X
"	X
F	X
"	X
goes	X
up	X
,	X
the	X
image	X
of	X
the	X
camera	X
's	X
aperture	X
gets	X
tighter	X
.	X

It	X
does	X
n't	X
take	X
long	X
to	X
sort	X
out	X
,	X
then	X
,	X
that	X
the	X
higher	X
the	X
"	X
f-stop	X
,"	X
the	X
more	X
closed	X
the	X
camera	X
's	X
aperture	X
.	X

Beginners	X
will	X
appreciate	X
the	X
fact	X
that	X
the	X
D40	X
has	X
a	X
knob	X
of	X
preset	X
modes	X
,	X
not	X
just	X
my	X
favorite	X
"	X
auto	X
"	X
mode	X
but	X
"	X
portrait	X
,"	X
"	X
sports	X
"	X
and	X
more	X
.	X

What	X
's	X
cool	X
is	X
that	X
,	X
when	X
you	X
change	X
modes	X
,	X
the	X
screen	X
shows	X
the	X
changed	X
settings	X
.	X

Little	X
by	X
little	X
,	X
the	X
notions	X
will	X
start	X
to	X
sink	X
in	X
:	X
what	X
the	X
camera	X
is	X
trying	X
to	X
do	X
to	X
shoot	X
action	X
,	X
what	X
it	X
needs	X
to	X
take	X
a	X
portrait	X
at	X
night	X
,	X
etc	X
.	X

The	X
D40	X
is	X
also	X
an	X
editor	X
.	X

Once	X
,	X
I	X
was	X
shooting	X
at	X
a	X
high-school	X
graduation	X
,	X
and	X
I	X
realized	X
halfway	X
through	X
that	X
a	X
setting	X
was	X
making	X
my	X
pictures	X
too	X
dim	X
.	X

When	X
I	X
got	X
home	X
,	X
I	X
had	X
to	X
adjust	X
them	X
in	X
Photoshop	X
Elements	X
.	X

If	X
I	X
make	X
the	X
same	X
blunder	X
on	X
the	X
D40	X
,	X
I	X
could	X
lighten	X
up	X
the	X
shots	X
right	X
on	X
the	X
camera	X
,	X
which	X
saves	X
the	X
edited	X
image	X
as	X
a	X
separate	X
file	X
,	X
in	X
case	X
you	X
do	X
n't	X
like	X
the	X
fix	X
.	X

This	X
is	X
helpful	X
not	X
just	X
when	X
you	X
're	X
clumsy	X
,	X
as	X
I	X
was	X
,	X
but	X
when	X
you	X
say	X
,	X
shoot	X
in	X
low	X
light	X
and	X
want	X
to	X
edit	X
out	X
the	X
yellowish	X
cast	X
that	X
always	X
appears	X
,	X
or	X
if	X
you	X
shoot	X
something	X
wide	X
and	X
think	X
it	X
would	X
look	X
better	X
cropped	X
.	X

To	X
top	X
it	X
all	X
off	X
,	X
the	X
D40	X
is	X
smaller	X
than	X
the	X
other	X
Nikons	X
.	X

There	X
's	X
still	X
no	X
chance	X
you	X
'll	X
be	X
able	X
to	X
stick	X
it	X
in	X
your	X
pocket	X
,	X
removable	X
zoom	X
lens	X
or	X
not	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
is	X
n't	X
as	X
much	X
bulk	X
when	X
you	X
're	X
on	X
safari	X
.	X

Shooting	X
wise	X
,	X
I	X
would	X
not	X
be	X
able	X
to	X
tell	X
the	X
difference	X
between	X
it	X
and	X

up	X
to	X

in	X

He	X
must	X
have	X
something	X
interesting	X
to	X
say	X
or	X
he	X
would	X
n't	X
bother	X
and	X
many	X

criticised	X
the	X

for	X
not	X
giving	X
more	X
details	X
about	X
some	X
of	X
their	X
plans	X
during	X

campaign	X

Remember	X
,	X
he	X
's	X
planning	X
to	X
cut	X
overall	X
spending	X
by	X
1	X
%	X
for	X
the	X
next	X
two	X
years	X
and	X
then	X
freeze	X
it	X
in	X
the	X
third	X
year	X
to	X
get	X
rid	X
of	X
the	X
deficit	X
.	X

One	X
of	X
the	X
biggest	X
questions	X
will	X
be	X
where	X
he	X
plans	X
to	X
find	X
the	X
promised	X
Â£	X
12bn	X
of	X
cuts	X
in	X
welfare	X
spending	X
by	X
2017-18	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
not	X
going	X
to	X
be	X
easy	X
because	X
he	X
and	X
the	X
prime	X
minister	X
have	X
ruled	X
out	X
reductions	X
to	X
so	X
many	X
benefits	X
.	X

With	X
the	X
prime	X
minister	X
having	X
said	X
that	X
he	X
will	X
not	X
cut	X
pensioner	X
benefits	X
or	X
child	X
benefit	X
,	X
you	X
can	X
see	X
from	X
the	X
chart	X
above	X
why	X
he	X
is	X
expected	X
to	X
have	X
to	X
cut	X
working	X
tax	X
credits	X
and	X
housing	X
benefit	X
.	X

He	X
may	X
still	X
not	X
give	X
full	X
details	X
of	X
where	X
the	X
cuts	X
will	X
come	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
would	X
be	X
surprising	X
if	X
we	X
did	X
not	X
know	X
any	X
more	X
about	X
it	X
by	X
the	X
end	X
of	X
the	X
day	X
.	X

You	X
can	X
see	X
from	X
the	X
chart	X
below	X
how	X
Mr	X
Osborne	X
is	X
hoping	X
to	X
bring	X
tax	X
revenues	X
and	X
spending	X
closer	X
to	X
each	X
other	X
to	X
get	X
rid	X
of	X
the	X
annual	X
budget	X
deficit	X
during	X
this	X
parliament	X
.	X

Clearly	X
,	X
almost	X
all	X
of	X
the	X
plans	X
come	X
from	X
cuts	X
to	X
spending	X
as	X
opposed	X
to	X
a	X
rise	X
in	X
taxes	X
.	X

Among	X
the	X
measures	X
designed	X
to	X
raise	X
more	X
money	X
is	X
Â£	X
5bn	X
in	X
savings	X
from	X
anti-avoidance	X
measures	X
,	X
which	X
may	X
or	X
may	X
not	X
happen	X
.	X

The	X
government	X
also	X
has	X
to	X
fund	X
Â£	X
4bn	X
in	X
tax	X
cuts	X
that	X
it	X
promised	X
before	X
the	X
election	X
,	X
which	X
includes	X
things	X
like	X
extra	X
childcare	X
provision	X
and	X
raising	X
the	X
stamp	X
duty	X
threshold	X
.	X

This	X
turns	X
attention	X
towards	X
departmental	X
spending	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
not	X
clear	X
how	X
much	X
detail	X
we	X
will	X
get	X
on	X
departmental	X
spending	X
in	X
this	X
Budget	X
and	X
how	X
much	X
will	X
be	X
saved	X
up	X
for	X
a	X
Spending	X
Review	X
later	X
in	X
the	X
year	X
.	X

The	X
Institute	X
for	X
Fiscal	X
Studies	X
says	X
that	X
taking	X
account	X
of	X
areas	X
of	X
spending	X
that	X
have	X
to	X
rise	X
,	X
Mr	X
Osborne	X
has	X
to	X
find	X
Â£	X
30bn	X
of	X
departmental	X
spending	X
cuts	X
by	X
2018-19	X
.	X

He	X
has	X
already	X
announced	X
that	X
Â£	X
3bn	X
has	X
been	X
found	X
in	X
efficiency	X
savings	X
across	X
departments	X
this	X
year	X
.	X

In	X
the	X
last	X
parliament	X
,	X
the	X
government	X
had	X
a	X
pretty	X
good	X
record	X
of	X
achieving	X
the	X
cuts	X
it	X
wanted	X
in	X
departmental	X
spending	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
is	X
likely	X
to	X
be	X
more	X
difficult	X
this	X
time	X
round	X
.	X

You	X
would	X
expect	X
the	X
government	X
to	X
make	X
the	X
easiest	X
cuts	X
first	X
and	X
it	X
has	X
quite	X
a	X
small	X
majority	X
in	X
the	X
House	X
of	X
Commons	X
if	X
any	X
of	X
the	X
measures	X
prove	X
unpopular	X
among	X
its	X
back-benchers	X
.	X

In	X
addition	X
,	X
the	X
cost	X
of	X
public	X
sector	X
pensions	X
keeps	X
rising	X
as	X
more	X
public	X
sector	X
workers	X
retire	X
and	X
live	X
longer	X
.	X

While	X
the	X
amount	X
the	X
government	X
is	X
borrowing	X
each	X
year	X
is	X
falling	X
,	X
the	X
total	X
amount	X
it	X
has	X
borrowed	X
is	X
still	X
increasing	X
,	X
which	X
means	X
interest	X
must	X
be	X
paid	X
on	X
more	X
money	X
,	X
albeit	X
at	X
a	X
very	X
low	X
interest	X
rate	X
.	X

Spending	X
on	X
the	X
National	X
Health	X
Service	X
is	X
not	X
only	X
protected	X
-	X
the	X
government	X
has	X
promised	X
to	X
be	X
spending	X
an	X
extra	X
Â£	X
8bn	X
a	X
year	X
on	X
it	X
by	X
2020	X
,	X
which	X
implies	X
bigger	X
cuts	X
in	X
other	X
departments	X
.	X

Education	X
spending	X
is	X
protected	X
for	X
children	X
aged	X
five	X
to	X
16	X
in	X
terms	X
of	X
cash	X
per	X
pupil	X
,	X
so	X
rising	X
pupil	X
numbers	X
would	X
also	X
need	X
to	X
be	X
made	X
up	X
for	X
by	X
cuts	X
elsewhere	X
.	X

And	X
international	X
aid	X
is	X
also	X
protected	X
,	X
and	X
will	X
grow	X
in	X
line	X
with	X
the	X
economy	X
.	X

As	X
a	X
result	X
,	X
the	X
IFS	X
reckons	X
that	X
the	X
current	X
plans	X
to	X
cut	X
spending	X
by	X
1	X
%	X
for	X
the	X
next	X
two	X

it	X

will	X
actually	X

cuts	X
for	X
unprotected	X
departments	X
averaging	X
5.4	X
%	X
a	X
year	X
for	X
three	X
years	X
.	X

That	X
will	X
come	X
on	X

of	X
the	X
cuts	X
that	X
have	X
already	X
been	X
made	X

COURTESY	X
OF	X
CINGULAR	X

November	X
has	X
been	X
a	X
busy	X
month	X
for	X
Cingular	X
,	X
which	X
launched	X
the	X
Sync	X
music	X
phone	X
and	X
BlackJack	X
Windows	X
Mobile	X
smartphone	X
,	X
both	X
by	X
Samsung	X
,	X
and	X
then	X
the	X
eagerly	X
awaited	X
Palm	X
Treo	X
680	X
.	X

My	X
original	X
intention	X
was	X
to	X
review	X
the	X
Treo	X
680	X
,	X
but	X
I	X
decided	X
there	X
just	X
is	X
n't	X
enough	X
to	X
say	X
about	X
it	X
:	X
it	X
's	X
no	X
slimmer	X
than	X
its	X
predecessors	X
,	X
and	X
Cingular	X
will	X
have	X
to	X
pack	X
better	X
,	X
user-friendly	X
e-mail	X
software	X
into	X
it	X
if	X
it	X
's	X
going	X
to	X
attract	X
non-corporate	X
types	X
,	X
or	X
indeed	X
anybody	X
but	X
Palm	X
customers	X
in	X
search	X
of	X
a	X
replacement	X
to	X
their	X
Treo	X
650	X
.	X

The	X
BlackJack	X
was	X
a	X
bit	X
of	X
a	X
letdown	X
too	X
.	X

When	X
it	X
comes	X
to	X
managing	X
personal	X
e-mail	X
,	X
it	X
ca	X
n't	X
touch	X
T-Mobile	X
's	X
BlackBerry	X
Pearl	X
,	X
and	X
as	X
far	X
as	X
the	X
glitzy	X
marketing	X
campaign	X
("	X
compact	X
3G	X
PDA	X
that	X
can	X
do	X
it	X
all	X
")	X
,	X
just	X
remember	X
that	X
it	X
still	X
runs	X
on	X
the	X
cumbersome	X
,	X
unresponsive	X
Windows	X
Mobile	X
platform	X
.	X

Many	X
Windows	X
Mobile	X
devices	X
have	X
crossed	X
my	X
path	X
of	X
late	X
,	X
and	X
none	X
of	X
them	X
have	X
been	X
worth	X
discussing	X
at	X
length	X
.	X

No	X
,	X
the	X
smarter	X
of	X
Cingular	X
's	X
offerings	X
tend	X
to	X
leave	X
me	X
dumb	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
the	X
Sync	X
,	X
a	X
jam-packed	X
regular	X
phone	X
,	X
that	X
has	X
held	X
my	X
attention	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
not	X
perfect	X
,	X
but	X
it	X
is	X
the	X
key	X
to	X
Cingular	X
's	X
next	X
wave	X
of	X
phonesphones	X
I	X
'm	X
quite	X
optimistic	X
about	X
.	X

The	X
Sync	X
,	X
aka	X
Samsung	X
SGH-a707	X
,	X
is	X
pretty	X
much	X
RAZR	X
slim	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
got	X
a	X
respectable	X
talk-time	X
battery	X
life	X
of	X
up	X
to	X
four	X
hours	X
and	X
a	X
gorgeous	X
,	X
2.5-in	X
.	X

LCD	X
screen	X
.	X

Since	X
it	X
connects	X
to	X
Cingular	X
's	X
new	X
highspeed	X
data	X
network	X
,	X
it	X
can	X
download	X
files	X
at	X
broadband	X
speed	X
.	X

Although	X
the	X
network	X
is	X
key	X
to	X
much	X
of	X
Cingular	X
's	X
ambitions	X
,	X
it	X
is	X
not	X
required	X
to	X
access	X
music	X
,	X
however	X
.	X

The	X
Sync	X
is	X
so-named	X
because	X
you	X
load	X
music	X
from	X
your	X
PC	X
.	X

Any	X
MP3	X
or	X
unprotected	X
WMA	X
files	X
will	X
transfer	X
,	X
but	X
so	X
will	X
subscription	X
downloads	X
from	X
Rhapsody	X
,	X
Napster	X
,	X
AOL	X
and	X
MTV	X
Urge	X
.	X

In	X
other	X
words	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
pay	X
$	X
15	X
per	X
month	X
for	X
all-you-can-eat	X
music	X
,	X
the	X
Sync	X
will	X
,	X
in	X
theory	X
,	X
act	X
as	X
a	X
vessel	X
for	X
your	X
downloads	X
.	X

I	X
say	X
"	X
in	X
theory	X
"	X
because	X
the	X
truth	X
is	X
,	X
although	X
I	X
tested	X
two	X
Syncs	X
with	X
two	X
separate	X
music	X
services	X
,	X
I	X
never	X
actually	X
got	X
one	X
to	X
transfer	X
protected	X
content	X
.	X

The	X
bane	X
of	X
the	X
subscription	X
services	X
,	X
the	X
reason	X
they	X
ca	X
n't	X
compete	X
with	X
iTunes	X
,	X
is	X
that	X
they	X
do	X
n't	X
work	X
100	X
%	X
of	X
the	X
time	X
.	X

In	X
the	X
past	X
,	X
my	X
enthusiasm	X
for	X
the	X
subscription	X
model	X
has	X
been	X
stymied	X
by	X
just	X
such	X
technical	X
snafus	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
the	X
kinks	X
usually	X
work	X
themselves	X
out	X
,	X
and	X
I	X
know	X
that	X
both	X
Cingular	X
and	X
Samsung	X
have	X
been	X
feverishly	X
working	X
to	X
improve	X
the	X
synching	X
capability	X
of	X
the	X
Sync	X
.	X

My	X
love	X
for	X
this	X
phone	X
in	X
fact	X
has	X
nothing	X
to	X
do	X
with	X
the	X
music	X
platform	X
,	X
though	X
tracks	X
do	X
sound	X
amazing	X
through	X
the	X
Sync	X
's	X
hidden	X
speaker	X
.	X

No	X
,	X
what	X
I	X
like	X
best	X
about	X
the	X
phone	X
is	X
its	X
e-mail	X
program	X
.	X

Easier	X
to	X
use	X
than	X
anything	X
pre-loaded	X
on	X
the	X
Treo	X
680	X
or	X
the	X
BlackJack	X
,	X
the	X
Sync	X
's	X
e-mail	X
manager	X
requires	X
nothing	X
but	X
your	X
e-mail	X
address	X
and	X
password	X
for	X
set	X
up	X
,	X
and	X
manages	X
most	X
major	X
webmail	X
providers	X
,	X
including	X
the	X
trickier	X
ones	X
like	X
MSN	X
's	X
Hotmail	X
and	X
AOL	X
's	X
AIM	X
Mail	X
.	X

You	X
can	X
even	X
manage	X
multiple	X
e-mail	X
accounts	X
simultaneously	X
.	X

The	X
interface	X
is	X
smooth	X
and	X
simple	X
;	X
in	X
truth	X
,	X
I	X
have	X
never	X
seen	X
a	X
better	X
looking	X
e-mail	X
program	X
on	X
a	X
standard	X
cell	X
phone	X
.	X

The	X
only	X
hiccup	X
,	X
and	X
mind	X
you	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
a	X
biggie	X
,	X
is	X
that	X
you	X
still	X
have	X
to	X
key	X
in	X
your	X
text	X
with	X
the	X
number	X
pad	X
.	X

Until	X
the	X
same	X
phone	X
comes	X
out	X
with	X
a	X
QWERTY	X
keypad	X
,	X
it	X
'll	X
be	X
more	X
of	X
an	X
e-mail	X
reader	X
than	X
anything	X
else	X
.	X

Cingular	X
says	X
that	X
the	X
e-mail	X
program	X
,	X
making	X
its	X
debut	X
on	X
the	X
Sync	X
,	X
will	X
be	X
loaded	X
onto	X
many	X
other	X
phones	X
in	X
the	X
coming	X
months	X
.	X

The	X
company	X
also	X
says	X
that	X
the	X
music	X
synching	X
system	X
launched	X
with	X
the	X
Sync	X
will	X
appear	X
in	X
more	X
and	X
more	X
standard	X
handsets	X
.	X

Even	X
though	X
I	X
had	X
troubles	X
with	X
both	X
,	X
I	X
'm	X
looking	X
forward	X
to	X
the	X
next	X
"	X
regular	X
"	X
phones	X
Cingular	X
has	X
to	X
offer	X
.	X

I	X
do	X
n't	X
need	X
over-the-air	X
downloads	X
of	X
overpriced	X
music	X
when	X
I	X
've	X
got	X
gobs	X
of	X
tunes	X
on	X
my	X
computer	X
;	X
I	X
definitely	X
do	X
need	X
better	X
access	X
to	X
my	X
e-mail	X
,	X
much	X
more	X
of	X
an	X
on-the-go	X
necessity	X
.	X

When	X
it	X
comes	X
to	X
getting	X
these	X
two	X
key	X
priorities	X
straight	X
,	X
Cingular	X
seems	X
to	X
be	X
out	X
in	X
front	X
,	X
followed	X
by	X
T-Mobile	X
.	X

Sprint	X
and	X
Verizon	X
Wireless	X
are	X
,	X
sadly	X
,	X
bringing	X
up	X
the	X
rear	X
.	X

This	X
week	X
,	X
the	X
titans	X
are	X
clashing	X
.	X

Sony	X
and	X
Microsoft	X
,	X
both	X
notorious	X
for	X
pulling	X
out	X
all	X
the	X
stops	X
,	X
are	X
going	X
head	X
to	X
head	X
with	X
their	X
latest	X
game	X
machines	X
.	X

Although	X
not	X
a	X
gamer	X
,	X
I	X
'm	X
drawn	X
to	X
the	X
PS3	X
and	X
the	X
Xbox	X
360	X
(	X
and	X
its	X
new	X
trimmings	X
)	X
as	X
feats	X
of	X
hitherto	X
unseen	X
technological	X
wonder	X
.	X

Both	X
companies	X
have	X
bet	X
recklessly	X
on	X
their	X
platforms	X

,	X
and	X
both	X
see	X
them	X
as	X
gaming	X
plus	X
a	X
whole	X
lot	X
more	X
.	X

So	X
while	X
the	X
gaming	X
world	X
has	X
its	X
own	X
critiques	X

and	X
while	X
the	X
Nintendo	X
Wii	X
continues	X
to	X
charm	X
with	X
its	X
less	X
performance-based	X
attitude	X

my	X
desire	X
was	X
to	X
see	X
what	X
the	X
Xbox	X
and	X
PS3	X
could	X
do	X
in	X
the	X
way	X
of	X
movies	X
,	X
music	X
and	X
other	X
entertainment	X
.	X

I	X
tethered	X
both	X
of	X
them	X
to	X
a	X
smokin	X
'	X
46-in	X
.	X

Sharp	X
1080p	X
high-definition	X
LCD	X
TV	X
and	X
let	X
them	X
rip	X
.	X

Most	X
gamers	X
know	X
that	X
the	X
PS3	X
's	X
delay	X
was	X
caused	X
by	X
its	X
Blu-ray	X
drive	X
,	X
and	X
many	X
suggest	X
that	X
the	X
Blu-ray	X
advantage	X
is	X
n't	X
worth	X
the	X
price	X
or	X
the	X
wait	X
.	X

Sure	X
,	X
movies	X
on	X
Blu-ray	X
have	X
a	X
picture	X
quality	X
six	X
times	X
higher	X
than	X
a	X
standard	X
DVD	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
vast	X
majority	X
of	X
so-called	X
high	X
definition	X
TVs	X
do	X
n't	X
even	X
have	X
the	X
1920	X
x	X
1080	X
pixel	X
resolution	X
(	X
known	X
as	X
1080p	X
)	X
to	X
show	X
Blu-ray	X
's	X
full	X
glory	X
.	X

From	X
a	X
home-theater	X
point	X
of	X
view	X
,	X
though	X
,	X
the	X
PS3	X
was	X
not	X
only	X
the	X
first	X
Blu-ray	X
player	X
to	X
be	X
priced	X
well	X
under	X
$	X
1,000	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
first	X
to	X
be	X
introduced	X
from	X
Sony	X
,	X
the	X
mother	X
of	X
the	X
Blu-ray	X
initiative	X
.	X

In	X
other	X
words	X
,	X
for	X
anyone	X
who	X
already	X
has	X
a	X
sweet	X
1080p	X
TV	X
,	X
or	X
is	X
planning	X
to	X
spend	X
$	X
2,500	X
or	X
more	X
to	X
get	X
one	X
,	X
the	X
PS3	X
is	X
almost	X
a	X
requirement	X
,	X
being	X
one	X
of	X
the	X
only	X
reliable	X
sources	X
of	X
full	X
HD	X
video	X
.	X

If	X
you	X
do	X
n't	X
know	X
about	X
Blu-ray	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
because	X
it	X
's	X
not	X
the	X
only	X
successor	X
to	X
the	X
DVD	X
.	X

A	X
few	X
companies	X
,	X
including	X
Microsoft	X
,	X
support	X
a	X
different	X
standard	X
for	X
next-generation	X
movie	X
discs	X
,	X
called	X
HD	X
DVD	X
.	X

The	X
conflict	X
between	X
the	X
two	X
formats	X
has	X
made	X
it	X
tough	X
for	X
consumers	X
to	X
make	X
any	X
decisions	X
,	X
so	X
sales	X
have	X
been	X
miniscule	X

But	X
now	X
that	X
Sony	X
's	X
Blu-ray	X
is	X
appearing	X
in	X
Sony	X
's	X
eagerly	X
anticipated	X

the	X
Xbox-an	X

I	X
'm	X
a	X

of	X

even	X

more	X
affordable	X

I	X
can	X
vouch	X
for	X
the	X
fact	X
that	X
whether	X
they	X
're	X
on	X
Blu-ray	X
or	X

movies	X
look	X
much	X
better	X
than	X
they	X

Blu-ray	X
edition	X
of	X

The	X

Ricky	X
Bobby	X
that	X
comes	X
with	X
the	X

and	X
you	X
're	X
blown	X
away	X
by	X
the	X
detail	X
(	X
and	X
by	X
how	X
old	X
and	X
pockmarked	X
Will	X
Ferrell	X
and	X
John	X

look	X
up	X

Likewise	X

load	X
up	X
the	X
copy	X

Peter	X

King	X
Kong	X
that	X
ships	X
with	X
the	X
Xbox	X

fast	X
forward	X
to	X
an	X

suddenly	X

there	X
are	X

out	X

I	X
ca	X
n't	X
spot	X
the	X
difference	X
between	X
Blu-ray	X
and	X
HD	X
DVD	X
movie	X
;	X
no	X
one	X
but	X
the	X
most	X
finicky	X

.	X

So	X
when	X
looking	X
at	X
both	X
game	X
consoles	X
as	X
a	X
source	X
of	X
high-def	X
movie	X
content	X
,	X
forget	X
about	X
differences	X
in	X
video	X
quality	X
and	X
think	X
more	X
about	X
your	X
gaming	X
preferences	X
as	X
well	X
as	X
the	X
movies	X
themselves	X
,	X
the	X
Blu-ray	X
and	X
HD	X
DVD	X
lineups	X
on	X
Amazon.com	X
or	X
Netflix	X
.	X

As	X
similar	X
as	X
they	X
are	X
in	X
movie	X
playback	X
,	X
the	X
two	X
platforms	X
are	X
very	X
different	X
in	X
other	X
areas	X
.	X

The	X
PS3	X
thinks	X
locally	X
it	X
handles	X
content	X
best	X
when	X
it	X
's	X
on	X
its	X

plugged	X
in	X
directly	X
.	X

The	X
Xbox	X
360	X
is	X
all	X
about	X
the	X
network	X
.	X

I	X
take	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
pictures	X
,	X
and	X
was	X
happy	X
to	X
see	X
that	X
the	X
PS3	X
came	X
with	X
card	X
readers	X
for	X
not	X
just	X
Sony	X
's	X
Memory	X
Stick	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
more	X
popular	X
SD	X
and	X
CompactFlash	X
as	X
well	X
.	X

You	X
can	X
move	X
photos	X
from	X
memory	X
card	X
to	X
hard	X
drive	X
and	X
back	X
to	X
memory	X
card	X
.	X

I	X
have	X
never	X
seen	X
a	X
device	X
scroll	X
through	X
high-resolution	X
photos	X
faster	X
than	X
the	X
PS3	X
,	X
certainly	X
never	X
blown	X
up	X
on	X
a	X
46-in.	X
monitor	X
.	X

It	X
even	X
renders	X
your	X
photos	X
in	X
realtime	X
into	X
a	X
3D	X
animated	X
slideshow	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
so	X
desire	X
.	X

Bringing	X
photos	X
to	X
the	X
PS3	X
for	X
review	X
makes	X
sense	X
,	X
but	X
in	X
this	X
era	X
,	X
carrying	X
music	X
on	X
CD	X
to	X
the	X
PS3	X
to	X
listen	X
makes	X
no	X
sense	X
at	X
all	X
.	X

Yet	X
that	X
's	X
what	X
Sony	X
expects	X
you	X
to	X
do	X
:	X
stick	X
in	X
a	X
CD	X
,	X
let	X
the	X
PS3	X
go	X
online	X
to	X
look	X
up	X
the	X
tracks	X
,	X
then	X
import	X
it	X
to	X
its	X
hard	X
drive	X
,	X
even	X
though	X
you	X
've	X
probably	X
got	X
thousands	X
of	X
songs	X
already	X
ripped	X
into	X
MP3	X
format	X
on	X
your	X
computer	X
's	X
hard	X

Team	X

knows	X
about	X
your	X
music	X
collection	X

If	X
the	X
Xbox	X
360	X
is	X
connected	X
to	X
your	X
home	X
network	X
(	X
via	X
Ethernet	X
or	X
a	X
$	X

,	X
you	X
can	X
quickly	X
pull	X
up	X
tracks	X
from	X
PCs	X
around	X
the	X
house	X
.	X

You	X
can	X
also	X
stream	X
photos	X
and	X
videos	X
,	X
although	X
not	X
all	X

are	X
supported	X
and	X
the	X

while	X
thorough	X

lacked	X
the	X
sophistication	X
of	X
the	X
PS3	X
.	X

Team	X
Xbox	X
also	X
knows	X
about	X
your	X
iPod	X
.	X

You	X
plug	X
it	X
directly	X
into	X
the	X
Xbox	X
360	X
to	X
play	X
any	X
tracks	X
but	X
the	X
ones	X
you	X
bought	X
on	X
iTunes	X
.	X

If	X
you	X
happen	X
to	X
have	X
a	X
Zune	X
,	X
you	X
may	X
plug	X
that	X
into	X
the	X
Xbox	X
360	X
as	X
well	X
.	X

It	X
wo	X
n't	X
shock	X
you	X
to	X
hear	X
that	X
when	X
I	X
plugged	X
the	X
iPod	X
and	X
the	X
Zune	X
into	X
one	X
of	X
the	X
PS3	X
's	X
many	X
USB	X
ports	X
,	X
nothing	X
happened	X
.	X

Of	X
course	X
,	X
the	X
PS3	X
does	X
support	X
music	X
served	X
up	X
from	X
the	X
PlayStation	X
Portable	X
,	X
if	X
that	X
's	X
where	X
you	X
keep	X
your	X
tunes	X
.	X

The	X
differences	X
continue	X
.	X

Xbox	X
has	X
a	X
thriving	X
online	X
community	X
and	X
plans	X
to	X
open	X
a	X
video	X
download	X
service	X
on	X
Nov	X

22.	X
However	X
,	X
it	X
does	X
n't	X
give	X
you	X
a	X
web	X
browser	X
.	X

The	X
PS3	X
does	X
have	X
a	X
browser	X
,	X
plus	X
built-in	X
Wi-Fi	X
and	X
support	X
for	X
Bluetooth	X
wireless	X
earpieces	X
.	X

The	X
craziest	X
thing	X
is	X
that	X
Sony	X
has	X
permitted	X
geeks	X
to	X
load	X
additional	X
operating	X
systems	X
onto	X
the	X
PS3	X
,	X
including	X
Linux	X
.	X

With	X
all	X
that	X
processing	X
power	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
a	X
generous	X
offer	X
,	X
although	X
probably	X
not	X
one	X
that	X
many	X
people	X
will	X
take	X
up	X
.	X

Both	X
the	X
PS3	X
and	X
Xbox	X
360	X
have	X
talent	X
beyond	X
their	X
ability	X
to	X
give	X
gamers	X
their	X
fix	X
.	X

Where	X
the	X
PS3	X
has	X
a	X
remarkable	X
aesthetic	X
elegance	X
,	X
the	X
Xbox	X
360	X
has	X
a	X
rugged	X
connectedness	X
.	X

Photographers	X
should	X
lean	X
towards	X
the	X
PS3	X
,	X
while	X
music	X
lovers	X
will	X
want	X
to	X
stick	X
with	X
the	X
Xbox	X
360	X
.	X

For	X
movie	X
buffs	X
,	X
the	X
confusion	X
is	X
greater	X
:	X
while	X
the	X
Blu-ray	X
format	X
is	X
backed	X
by	X
more	X
studios	X
,	X
the	X
new	X
Xbox	X
Marketplace	X
movie	X
and	X
TV	X
store	X
may	X
well	X
become	X
a	X
paragon	X
of	X
convenience	X
.	X

The	X
one	X
thing	X
I	X
do	X
know	X
for	X
sure	X
is	X
that	X
you	X
better	X
be	X
ready	X
to	X
pay	X
.	X

While	X
both	X
are	X
expensive	X
,	X
they	X
come	X
with	X
even	X
pricier	X
hidden	X
costs	X
:	X
to	X
maximize	X
your	X
enjoyment	X
,	X
you	X
need	X
a	X
really	X
nice	X
TV	X
.	X

Then	X
again	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
've	X
already	X
got	X
a	X
really	X
nice	X
TV	X
,	X
you	X
can	X
probably	X
afford	X
them	X
both	X

COURTESY	X
OF	X
MICROSOFT	X

Microsoft	X
has	X
been	X
the	X
dominant	X
force	X
in	X
computer	X
software	X
for	X
so	X
long	X
,	X
so	X
it	X
's	X
had	X
a	X
really	X
hard	X
time	X
with	X
Apple	X
's	X
supremacy	X
in	X
the	X
digital	X
music	X
space	X
.	X

Microsoft	X
first	X
tried	X
to	X
go	X
after	X
the	X
iPod	X
/	X
iTunes	X
juggernaut	X
by	X
providing	X
the	X
backbone	X
software	X
for	X
a	X
coalition	X
of	X
digital	X
media	X
companies	X
:	X
Creative	X
,	X
iriver	X
,	X
Samsung	X
and	X
others	X
on	X
the	X
hardware	X
side	X
;	X
Napster	X
and	X
even	X
competitors	X
such	X
as	X
Yahoo	X
!	X
and	X
RealNetworks	X
on	X
the	X
software	X
side	X
.	X

It	X
teamed	X
with	X
music	X
muscle	X
MTV	X
Networks	X
to	X
build	X
the	X
smartest	X
service	X
of	X
them	X
all	X
,	X
Urge	X
.	X

But	X
marketing	X
never	X
followed	X
Urge	X
's	X
soft	X
launch	X
,	X
and	X
it	X
's	X
still	X
foundering	X
.	X

Unable	X
to	X
lead	X
an	X
ever-changing	X
band	X
of	X
ornery	X
partners	X
,	X
Microsoft	X
finally	X
decided	X
that	X
the	X
only	X
way	X
to	X
go	X
after	X
Apple	X
was	X
to	X
go	X
it	X
alone	X
.	X

Microsoft	X
conceived	X
the	X
Zune	X
as	X
an	X
answer	X
to	X
iPod	X
,	X
with	X
attractive	X
similarities	X
as	X
well	X
as	X
key	X
features	X
that	X
the	X
iPod	X
lacks	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
very	X
much	X
like	X
an	X
iPod	X
at	X
$	X
250	X
,	X
the	X
30GB	X
music	X
and	X
video	X
player	X
is	X
the	X
same	X
price	X
as	X
an	X
iPod	X
,	X
only	X
a	X
little	X
larger	X
in	X
size	X
.	X

And	X
,	X
like	X
iTunes	X
,	X
the	X
Zune	X
software	X
combines	X
a	X
media	X
organizer	X
and	X
an	X
Internet	X
music	X
download	X
store	X
.	X

The	X
so-called	X
"	X
iPod	X
killer	X
"	X
additions	X
are	X
wireless	X
connectivity	X
for	X
Zune-to-Zune	X
sharing	X
of	X
music	X
samples	X
,	X
a	X
movie-friendly	X
wide	X
screen	X
,	X
and	X
an	X
"	X
all	X
you	X
can	X
eat	X
"	X
monthly	X
music	X
download	X
plan	X
.	X

The	X
Zune	X
follows	X
in	X
the	X
footsteps	X
of	X
the	X
successful	X
Xbox	X
,	X
but	X
unlike	X
the	X
videogame	X
business	X
,	X
where	X
there	X
are	X
only	X
a	X
few	X
companies	X
capable	X
of	X
launching	X
a	X
platform	X
at	X
any	X
given	X
time	X
,	X
the	X
Zune	X
enters	X
a	X
field	X
already	X
littered	X
with	X
MP3	X
players	X
.	X

Nearly	X
every	X
MP3	X
player	X
that	X
's	X
not	X
an	X
iPod	X
can	X
connect	X
to	X
a	X
monthly	X
subscription	X
service	X
:	X
any	X
new	X
flash	X
player	X
from	X
Samsung	X
,	X
iriver	X
,	X
SanDisk	X
or	X
Creative	X
will	X
synch	X
with	X
Napster	X
,	X
RealNetworks'	X
Rhapsody	X
,	X
Yahoo	X
's	X
Y	X
!	X

Unlimited	X
or	X
MTV	X
Urge	X
.	X

In	X
fact	X
,	X
even	X
Samsung	X
's	X
newest	X
Cingular	X
phone	X
,	X
appropriately	X
dubbed	X
the	X
Sync	X
,	X
can	X
do	X
this	X
.	X

So	X
the	X
question	X
is	X
n't	X
what	X
can	X
the	X
Zune	X
do	X
that	X
the	X
iPod	X
ca	X
n't	X
do	X
,	X
but	X
what	X
can	X
the	X
Zune	X
do	X
that	X
all	X
the	X
other	X
non-iPods	X
ca	X
n't	X
?	X

Microsoft	X
's	X
answer	X
is	X
wireless	X
connectivity	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
not	X
a	X
bad	X
idea	X
:	X
You	X
're	X
listening	X
to	X
a	X
song	X
and	X
think	X
,	X
hey	X
,	X
I	X
should	X
send	X
this	X
track	X
to	X
my	X
friend	X
.	X

You	X
click	X
on	X
the	X
song	X
's	X
name	X
,	X
then	X
select	X
"	X
Send	X
.	X
"	X

Nearby	X
Zunes	X
are	X
quickly	X
listed	X
,	X
and	X
you	X
select	X
your	X
friend	X
,	X
who	X
then	X
clicks	X
OK	X
to	X
permit	X
the	X
download	X
.	X

In	X
seconds	X
,	X
the	X
entire	X
song	X
is	X
transferred	X
.	X

Your	X
friend	X
has	X
three	X
days	X
to	X
listen	X
to	X
it	X
up	X
to	X
three	X
times	X
before	X
the	X
song	X
turns	X
into	X
a	X
pumpkin	X
,	X
albeit	X
a	X
pumpkin	X
your	X
friend	X
can	X
then	X
go	X
and	X
buy	X
at	X
the	X
Zune	X
Marketplace	X
.	X

I	X
'm	X
not	X
opposed	X
to	X
turning	X
youth	X
into	X
little	X
guerrilla	X
marketers	X
.	X

It	X
beats	X
thievery	X
and	X
is	X
more	X
honest	X
than	X
many	X
other	X
marketing	X
ploys	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
just	X
that	X
it	X
's	X
a	X
chicken-and-egg	X
proposition	X
:	X
it	X
might	X
take	X
a	X
long	X
time	X
before	X
there	X
are	X
enough	X
Zunes	X
around	X
for	X
this	X
to	X
be	X
more	X
than	X
a	X
once-in-a-blue-moon	X
situation	X
.	X

There	X
are	X
also	X
some	X
issues	X
that	X
will	X
,	X
hopefully	X
,	X
be	X
resolved	X
in	X
time	X
.	X

For	X
instance	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
want	X
to	X
share	X
the	X
song	X
you	X
're	X
listening	X
to	X
,	X
or	X
even	X
any	X
other	X
song	X
while	X
you	X
're	X
listening	X
,	X
your	X
tune	X
will	X
stop	X
playing	X
for	X
the	X
transfer	X
.	X

Also	X
,	X
even	X
if	X
both	X
Zune	X
users	X
have	X
all-you-can-eat	X
monthly	X
plans	X
,	X
the	X
three-day	X
,	X
three-play	X
rule	X
remains	X
in	X
effect	X
.	X

And	X
even	X
songs	X
with	X
no	X
rights-management	X
,	X
ones	X
you	X
ripped	X
from	X
storebought	X
CDs	X
,	X
are	X
slapped	X
with	X
the	X
limitation	X
as	X
well	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
like	X
an	X
iPod	X
,	X
you	X
can	X
synch	X
your	X
Zune	X
to	X
your	X
friend	X
's	X
PC	X
and	X
download	X
as	X
many	X
songs	X
as	X
you	X

GREATCALL	X

Smartphones	X
here	X
,	X
smartphones	X
therehow	X
about	X
a	X
dumb	X
phone	X
?	X

This	X
week	X
I	X
tested	X
the	X
Jitterbug	X
,	X
a	X
phone	X
designed	X
for	X
the	X
parents	X
of	X
baby	X
boomers	X
,	X
a	X
nice	X
way	X
of	X
saying	X
the	X
only	X
people	X
who	X
may	X
not	X
yet	X
have	X
cell	X
phones	X
.	X

Its	X
the	X
opposite	X
of	X
a	X
so-called	X
smartphonefar	X
from	X
push	X
e-mail	X
servers	X
and	X
multimedia	X
text	X
messages	X
,	X
this	X
phone	X
comes	X
pre-loaded	X
all	X
the	X
contacts	X
youll	X
ever	X
need	X
,	X
and	X
voicemail	X
is	X
optional	X
.	X

I	X
said	X
dumb	X
but	X
in	X
truth	X
,	X
this	X
simple	X
phone	X
may	X
be	X
one	X
of	X
the	X
smartest	X
designs	X
on	X
the	X
market	X
.	X

This	X
Jitterbug	X
has	X
excellent	X
pedigree	X
:	X
built	X
by	X
mighty	X
Samsung	X
,	X
it	X
was	X
co-designed	X
by	X
Martin	X
Cooper	X
,	X
the	X
man	X
who	X
made	X
the	X
first	X
cell-phone	X
call	X
in	X
1973	X
,	X
and	X
his	X
wife	X
,	X
Arlene	X
Harris	X
,	X
herself	X
a	X
telecom	X
pioneer	X
.	X

During	X
the	X
late	X
1990s	X
,	X
the	X
couple	X
created	X
the	X
SOS	X
Phone	X
for	X
people	X
who	X
just	X
wanted	X
something	X
around	X
in	X
case	X
of	X
emergencies	X
.	X

The	X
SOS	X
Phone	X
evolved	X
into	X
the	X
Jitterbug	X
,	X
the	X
star	X
of	X
Cooper	X
and	X
Harris	X
new	X
mobile	X
operator	X
,	X
GreatCall	X
.	X

The	X
strategy	X
is	X
simple	X
:	X
give	X
elderly	X
people	X
a	X
phone	X
that	X
they	X
can	X
use	X
,	X
with	X
larger	X
buttons	X
,	X
fewer	X
screen	X
options	X
and	X
a	X
padded	X
,	X
amplified	X
earpiece	X
that	X
doesnt	X
interfere	X
with	X
hearing	X
aids	X
.	X

Even	X
the	X
manual	X
comes	X
in	X
large	X
print	X
,	X
with	X
excessive	X
explanation	X
(	X
BatteryDelivers	X
power	X
to	X
make	X
your	X
phone	X
function	X
)	X
.	X

I	X
looked	X
at	X
the	X
Jitterbug	X
Dial	X
,	X
so	X
called	X
because	X
it	X
has	X
a	X
numeric	X
keypad	X
.	X

The	X
other	X
phone	X
(	X
also	X
$	X
147	X
)	X
is	X
the	X
Jitterbug	X
OneTouch	X

The	X
clear	X
message	X
here	X
is	X
that	X

for	X
people	X
who	X
are	X

I	X
just	X
dont	X
know	X
how	X
many	X
people	X
would	X
entrust	X
their	X

parents	X
safety	X

a	X

that	X
isnt	X

My	X
desire	X
is	X
to	X
see	X
this	X

somehow	X
become	X

COURTESY	X
OF	X
NOKIA	X

I	X
have	X
a	X
confession	X
to	X
make	X
:	X
I	X
've	X
never	X
fully	X
grasped	X
the	X
smart-phone	X
craze	X
.	X

I	X
've	X
played	X
around	X
with	X
most	X
of	X
them	X
,	X
yet	X
never	X
ended	X
up	X
needing	X
them	X
at	X
my	X
side	X
.	X

I	X
thought	X
it	X
was	X
me	X
,	X
but	X
I	X
'm	X
starting	X
to	X
realize	X
that	X
it	X
was	X
them	X
.	X

My	X
attitude	X
towards	X
smart	X
phones	X
,	X
or	X
mobile	X
PDAs	X
,	X
began	X
to	X
change	X
when	X
I	X
met	X
RIM	X
's	X
BlackBerry	X
Pearl	X
this	X
summer	X
.	X

I	X
could	X
suddenly	X
see	X
a	X
long-term	X
commitment	X
to	X
this	X
device	X
:	X
it	X
was	X
slim	X
and	X
phone-shaped	X
,	X
easy	X
to	X
use	X
but	X
smart	X
enough	X
to	X
bear	X
the	X
BlackBerry	X
name	X
.	X

(	X
With	X
a	X
T-Mobile	X
monthly	X
plan	X
of	X
around	X
$	X
60	X
,	X
it	X
was	X
also	X
surprisingly	X
low	X
maintenance	X
.	X
)	X

Since	X
then	X
,	X
I	X
've	X
been	X
on	X
the	X
prowl	X
for	X
other	X
mobile	X
PDAs	X
that	X
appeal	X
to	X
people	X
who	X
do	X
n't	X
need	X
mobile	X
e-mail	X
,	X
but	X
would	X
go	X
for	X
it	X
provided	X
it	X
was	X
n't	X
an	X
inconvenience	X
.	X

Nokia	X
's	X
new	X
E62	X
is	X
n't	X
perfect	X
,	X
but	X
out	X
of	X
the	X
box	X
it	X
has	X
many	X
user-friendly	X
traits	X
for	X
ordinary	X
people	X
those	X
who	X
have	X
n't	X
been	X
joined	X
at	X
the	X
hip	X
to	X
a	X
BlackBerry	X
,	X
Treo	X
or	X
Windows	X
Mobile	X
device	X
for	X
years	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
not	X
going	X
to	X
beat	X
the	X
Pearl	X
in	X
a	X
beauty	X
contest	X
,	X
but	X
the	X
5-oz	X
.	X

E62	X
fits	X
into	X
jacket	X
pockets	X
or	X
purses	X
just	X
fineit	X
's	X
definitely	X
thinner	X
than	X
a	X
Palm	X
Treo	X
.	X

It	X
's	X
got	X
a	X
bright	X
3-in.	X
screen	X
of	X
decent	X
resolution	X
,	X
a	X
wide	X
,	X
well	X
planned	X
QWERTY	X
keyboard	X
and	X
a	X
sturdy	X
body	X
backed	X
by	X
a	X
nice	X
aluminum	X
plate	X
.	X

It	X
takes	X
MiniSD	X
cards	X
,	X
and	X
although	X
you	X
need	X
to	X
remove	X
the	X
back	X
plate	X
to	X
insert	X
them	X
,	X
you	X
do	X
not	X
need	X
to	X
remove	X
the	X
battery	X
-	X
that	X
's	X
a	X
step	X
in	X
the	X
right	X
direction	X
for	X
Nokia	X
.	X

There	X
's	X
no	X
camera	X
,	X
but	X
you	X
probably	X
already	X
have	X
a	X
camera	X
.	X

When	X
you	X
power	X
up	X
the	X
E62	X
,	X
you	X
see	X
a	X
screen	X
like	X
many	X
other	X
smart	X
devices	X
:	X
a	X
row	X
of	X
icons	X
indicating	X
e-mail	X
,	X
calendar	X
,	X
web	X
browser	X
,	X
media	X
player	X
and	X
note	X
pad	X
.	X

There	X
's	X
a	X
hot	X
button	X
for	X
your	X
Address	X
Book	X
at	X
the	X
bottom	X
right	X
.	X

E-mail	X
setup	X
is	X
fairly	X
straightforward	X
as	X
long	X
as	X
you	X
know	X
the	X
correct	X
names	X
of	X
your	X
incoming	X
and	X
outgoing	X
mail	X
servers	X
(	X
example	X
:	X
pop.mail.yahoo.com	X
and	X
smtp.mail.yahoo.com	X
)	X
.	X

T-Mobile	X
's	X
setup	X
is	X
easier	X
,	X
but	X
like	X
the	X
BlackBerry	X
Pearl	X
,	X
the	X
E62	X
wo	X
n't	X
download	X
Hotmail	X
.	X

Unlike	X
many	X
business	X
PDAs	X
,	X
the	X
E62	X
does	X
n't	X
"	X
push	X
"	X
mail	X
to	X
you	X
automatically	X
.	X

Instead	X
,	X
you	X
set	X
it	X
to	X
check	X
for	X
mail	X
,	X
as	X
frequently	X
as	X
every	X
five	X
minutes	X

SLING	X
MEDIA	X

Two	X
TV	X
buzz	X
terms	X
you	X
might	X
hear	X
these	X
days	X
are	X
time	X
shifting	X
and	X
place	X
shifting	X
.	X

Time	X
shifting	X
is	X
what	X
a	X
TiVo	X
does	X
,	X
recording	X
something	X
in	X
the	X
8	X
pm	X
slot	X
that	X
you	X
watch	X
later	X
on	X
.	X

Place	X
shifting	X
is	X
what	X
a	X
Slingbox	X
does	X
,	X
giving	X
you	X
access	X
to	X
video	X
stored	X
up	X
in	X

it	X
on	X

hard	X
drivefrom	X
another	X
place	X
using	X
an	X
Internet-connected	X
PC	X
or	X
mobile	X
device	X
.	X

Until	X
now	X
,	X
Slingbox	X
couldnt	X
get	X
at	X
the	X
growing	X
mass	X
of	X
high-definition	X
programming	X
available	X
from	X
cable	X
or	X
satellite	X
providers	X
.	X

That	X
was	X
a	X
problem	X
in	X
my	X
house	X
,	X
since	X
we	X
record	X
most	X
primetime	X
shows	X
in	X
HD	X
using	X
a	X
cable	X
company-rented	X
Scientific	X
Atlanta	X
DVR	X
set-top	X
box	X
.	X

The	X
new	X
Slingbox	X
Pro	X
can	X
stream	X
any	X
standard	X
or	X
HD	X
show	X
stored	X
on	X
my	X
cable	X
box	X
,	X
at	X
a	X
reduced	X
quality	X
,	X
wherever	X
I	X
happen	X
to	X
be	X
.	X

Last	X
Friday	X
afternoon	X
,	X
I	X
was	X
racing	X
out	X
the	X
door	X
for	X
the	X
weekend	X
,	X
juggling	X
bags	X
of	X
groceries	X
,	X
bags	X
of	X
clothes	X
and	X
two	X
cats	X
,	X
each	X
in	X
its	X
own	X
carrier	X
.	X

At	X
4:11	X
pm	X
I	X
realized	X
I	X
had	X
forgotten	X
to	X
setup	X
the	X
Slingbox	X
Pro	X
,	X
so	X
we	X
could	X
watch	X
our	X
home	X
TV	X
while	X
out	X
of	X
town	X
.	X

Determined	X
to	X
set	X
a	X
record	X
for	X
Slingbox	X
setup	X
,	X
I	X
pulled	X
out	X
the	X
quick-start	X
guide	X
and	X
rolled	X
up	X
my	X
sleeves	X
.	X

I	X
connected	X
wires	X
for	X
video	X
,	X
networking	X
and	X
power	X
in	X
a	X
particular	X
order	X
.	X

Then	X
I	X
powered	X
everything	X
on	X
and	X
popped	X
the	X
software	X
disc	X
into	X
a	X
PC	X
laptop	X
.	X

(	X
Alas	X
,	X
Slingbox	X
does	X
n't	X
work	X
for	X
Macs	X
at	X
the	X
moment	X
.	X
)	X

The	X
software	X
found	X
the	X
Slingbox	X
,	X
tested	X
its	X
video	X
,	X
then	X
found	X
my	X
network	X
router	X
and	X
automatically	X
configured	X
it	X
to	X
stream	X
video	X
over	X
the	X
open	X
Internet	X
,	X
not	X
just	X
on	X
my	X
home	X
network	X
.	X

Theres	X
a	X
do	X
it	X
yourself	X
mode	X
,	X
but	X
take	X
my	X
advice	X
,	X
nerds	X
,	X
and	X
let	X
Slings	X
software	X
take	X
the	X
first	X
crack	X
it	X
was	X
very	X
fast	X
,	X
and	X
saved	X
me	X
from	X
having	X
to	X
log	X
into	X
my	X
router	X
,	X
let	X
alone	X
recalling	X
frighteningly	X
geeky	X
concepts	X
such	X
as	X
port	X
forwarding	X
.	X

On	X
the	X
screen	X
flashed	X
a	X
message	X
that	X
everything	X
was	X
good	X
to	X
go	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
4:23	X
pm	X
.	X

The	X
following	X
evening	X
,	X
my	X
wife	X
and	X
I	X
were	X
telling	X
our	X
friends	X
about	X
Tina	X
Feys	X
hilarious	X
new	X
NBC	X
sitcom	X
,	X
30	X
Rock	X
,	X
but	X
found	X
we	X
couldnt	X
do	X
it	X
justice	X
.	X

I	X
suddenly	X
realized	X
that	X
I	X
could	X
simply	X
stream	X
the	X
pilot	X
episode	X
,	X
via	X
laptop	X
,	X
from	X
my	X
cable	X
box	X
at	X
home	X
.	X

We	X
gathered	X
around	X
the	X
dining	X
room	X
table	X
,	X
and	X
I	X
launched	X
the	X
SlingPlayer	X
,	X
which	X
produced	X
a	X
virtual	X
remote	X
control	X
identical	X
to	X
the	X
one	X
sitting	X
on	X
my	X
coffee	X
table	X
back	X
home	X
.	X

Within	X
seconds	X
we	X
were	X
watching	X
a	X
show	X
I	X
had	X
originally	X
recorded	X
in	X
high-def	X
.	X

It	X
may	X
not	X
have	X
looked	X
as	X
goodthe	X
already	X
scaled	X

degrades	X
a	X
bit	X
over	X
the	X

it	X
was	X
just	X
as	X
funny	X

If	X
youre	X
not	X
yet	X

may	X
not	X

The	X

the	X
new	X

in	X
the	X

Britain	X

potential	X
involvement	X
in	X
the	X
air	X
campaign	X
against	X
so-called	X
Islamic	X
State	X
targets	X
in	X
Syria	X
now	X
looks	X
to	X
be	X
squarely	X
back	X
on	X
the	X
agenda	X
.	X

Defence	X
Secretary	X
Michael	X
Fallon	X
is	X
preparing	X
the	X
ground	X
and	X
the	X
government	X
clearly	X
believes	X

in	X
the	X
wake	X
of	X
the	X
deadly	X
attack	X
against	X
tourists	X
in	X
Tunisia	X
is	X
sufficiently	X
different	X
to	X
secure	X
parliamentary	X
backing	X
for	X
such	X
a	X
move	X
.	X

In	X
2013	X
,	X
the	X
issue	X
was	X
whether	X
to	X
mount	X
attacks	X
against	X
targets	X
associated	X
with	X
the	X
regime	X
of	X
Syrian	X
president	X
Bashar	X
al-Assad	X

Now	X
the	X
goal	X
would	X
be	X
very	X
different	X
;	X
to	X
join	X
in	X
the	X
air	X
campaign	X
that	X
is	X
already	X
being	X
waged	X
against	X
Islamic	X
State	X
(	X
IS	X
)	X
militants	X
by	X
US	X
warplanes	X
along	X
with	X
those	X
of	X
a	X
number	X
of	X
its	X
Arab	X
allies	X
.	X

So	X
far	X
,	X
Canada	X
is	X
the	X
only	X
other	X
Nato	X
country	X
apart	X
from	X
the	X
US	X
to	X
join	X
this	X
part	X
of	X
the	X
air	X
campaign	X

Flying	X
every	X
day	X

Like	X
Britain	X
,	X
most	X
Western	X
countries	X
have	X
felt	X
more	X
comfortable	X
restricting	X
their	X
air	X
attacks	X
to	X
targets	X
in	X
Iraq	X
.	X

Nonetheless	X
,	X
Britain	X
has	X
been	X
carrying	X
out	X
intelligence-gathering	X
flights	X
over	X
Syria	X
with	X
a	X
variety	X
of	X
aircraft	X
.	X

So	X
what	X
would	X
be	X
the	X
significance	X
of	X
Britain	X
extending	X
its	X
operations	X
to	X
Syria	X
and	X
what	X
difference	X
might	X
it	X
make	X
?	X

In	X
practical	X
terms	X
,	X
Britain	X
's	X
air	X
operations	X
over	X
Iraq	X
involve	X
eight	X
Tornado	X
warplanes	X
flying	X
out	X
of	X
Cyprus	X
and	X
a	X
small	X
number	X
of	X
Reaper	X
unmanned	X
aerial	X
vehicles	X
from	X
Kuwait	X
.	X

British	X
aircraft	X
are	X
in	X
the	X
air	X
pretty	X
well	X
every	X
day	X
though	X
actual	X
attacks	X
are	X
sporadic	X
.	X

Weapons	X
may	X
be	X
dropped	X
for	X
three	X
or	X
four	X
days	X
in	X
a	X
row	X
,	X
then	X
there	X
may	X
be	X
a	X
couple	X
of	X
days'	X
gap	X
when	X
,	X
for	X
whatever	X
reason	X
,	X
either	X
no	X
suitable	X
targets	X
are	X
found	X
or	X
essential	X
maintenance	X
is	X
being	X
conducted	X
,	X
no	X
weapons	X
are	X
released	X
.	X

'	X
No	X
dramatic	X
increase	X
'	X

British	X
air	X
assets	X
are	X
also	X
of	X
vital	X
importance	X
for	X
reconnaissance	X
,	X
its	X
aircraft	X
being	X
equipped	X
with	X
highly	X
sophisticated	X
electronics	X
to	X
gather	X
a	X
picture	X
of	X
what	X
is	X
happening	X
on	X
the	X
ground	X
.	X

In	X
purely	X
military	X
terms	X
then	X
,	X
an	X
expansion	X
of	X
RAF	X
operations	X
to	X
Syria	X
would	X
add	X
some	X
useful	X
capability	X
,	X
but	X
would	X
not	X
signal	X
a	X
dramatic	X
change	X
in	X
the	X
tempo	X
of	X
attacks	X
.	X

The	X
Canadian	X
Air	X
Force	X
has	X
found	X
target	X
acquisition	X
quite	X
difficult	X
in	X
Syria	X
given	X
that	X
there	X
are	X
no	X
"	X
allied	X
"	X
forces	X
on	X
the	X
ground	X
performing	X
the	X
same	X
role	X
as	X
the	X
Iraqi	X
military	X
.	X

A	X
Tornado	X
returning	X
from	X
Operation	X
Shader	X
duties	X
in	X
Iraq	X

Might	X
Britain	X
need	X
to	X
find	X
more	X
resources	X
for	X
an	X
expanded	X
air	X
operation	X
?	X

The	X
Tornados	X
are	X
capable	X
but	X
old	X
airframes	X
.	X

More	X
aircraft	X
would	X
certainly	X
add	X
to	X
the	X
cost	X
of	X
the	X
operation	X
with	X
more	X
munitions	X
expended	X
and	X
so	X
on	X
.	X

And	X
of	X
course	X
there	X
is	X
no	X
indication	X
of	X
any	X
end	X
to	X
this	X
air	X
campaign	X

a	X
week	X

when	X

spot	X

along	X

how	X
often	X

average	X

every	X
five	X
minutes	X
for	X
the	X
past	X
seven	X
days	X

If	X
a	X
tag	X
is	X
suddenly	X
more	X
popular	X
than	X
usual	X
,	X
a	X
trend	X
may	X
be	X
afoot	X
.	X

The	X
researchers	X
noted	X
that	X
they	X
could	X
use	X
more	X
complex	X
neural	X
network-driven	X
models	X
to	X
calculate	X
when	X
a	X
hashtag	X
hits	X
that	X
point	X
of	X
popularity	X
to	X
make	X
it	X
a	X
genuine	X
trend	X
,	X
but	X
a	X
simple	X
comparison	X
to	X
the	X
prior	X
seven	X
days	X
worth	X
of	X
measurements	X
does	X
the	X
job	X
well	X
enough	X
,	X
they	X
note	X
,	X
and	X
can	X
spot	X
the	X
big	X
trends	X
with	X
relatively	X
lightweight	X
requirements	X
for	X
computing	X
processing	X
and	X
memory	X
.	X

The	X
model	X
also	X
takes	X
into	X
account	X
the	X
decline	X
of	X
hashtags	X
when	X
an	X
event	X
is	X
over	X
.	X

"	X
The	X
amount	X
of	X
posts	X
using	X
a	X
hashtag	X
that	X
is	X
trending	X
at	X
the	X
moment	X
will	X
naturally	X
decrease	X
as	X
soon	X
as	X
the	X
event	X
is	X
finished	X
,"	X
they	X
write	X
.	X

This	X
can	X
be	X
problematic	X
insofar	X
people	X
still	X
want	X
to	X
see	X
pictures	X
of	X
an	X
event	X
after	X
it	X
has	X
happened	X
,	X
so	X
Instagram	X
built	X
in	X
a	X
decay	X
,	X
or	X
half-life	X
,	X
function	X
that	X
helps	X
highlight	X
the	X
trend	X
in	X
the	X
hours	X
following	X
the	X
event	X
itself	X
.	X

Another	X
potential	X
confounding	X
issue	X
is	X
that	X
multiple	X
hashtags	X
may	X
be	X
applied	X
to	X
the	X
same	X
event	X

For	X
instance	X
,	X
the	X
#	X
fashionweek	X
tag	X
is	X
frequently	X
joined	X
by	X
#	X
model	X
and	X
#	X
fashion	X
.	X

So	X
the	X
development	X
teams	X
wrote	X
an	X
algorithm	X
that	X
clusters	X
together	X
hashtags	X
that	X
refer	X
to	X
the	X
same	X
event	X
.	X

It	X
looks	X
at	X
how	X
often	X
hashtags	X
are	X
paired	X
together	X
,	X
such	X
as	X
#	X
equality	X
and	X
#	X
lovewins	X
.	X

It	X
looks	X
at	X
words	X
that	X
are	X
very	X
similar	X
,	X
in	X
order	X
to	X
detect	X
misspellings	X
,	X
so	X
that	X
#	X
valentinesday	X
and	X
#	X
valentineday	X
are	X
clumped	X
together	X
.	X

It	X
also	X
runs	X
an	X
internal	X
tool	X
that	X
classifies	X
tags	X
into	X
a	X
predefined	X
set	X
of	X
topics	X

Minister	X
David	X
Cameron	X
also	X
observed	X
a	X
minute	X
of	X
silence	X
at	X
noon	X
Friday	X
.	X

The	X
final	X
decision	X
on	X
expanding	X
aviation	X
capacity	X
was	X
always	X
going	X
to	X
be	X
far	X
more	X
to	X
do	X
with	X
politics	X
than	X
economics	X
.	X

And	X
to	X
understand	X
why	X
,	X
it	X
is	X
worth	X
remembering	X
a	X
pledge	X
made	X
by	X
David	X
Cameron	X
in	X
2009	X
,	X
with	X
"	X
no	X
ifs	X
or	X
buts	X
"	X

There	X
would	X
be	X
no	X
new	X
runway	X
at	X
Heathrow	X
,	X
Mr	X
Cameron	X
said	X
.	X

Deciding	X
that	X
it	X
is	X
time	X
to	X
overturn	X
that	X
pledge	X
would	X
certainly	X
be	X
a	X
difficult	X
one	X
for	X
the	X
Prime	X
Minister	X
to	X
swallow	X
.	X

And	X
those	X
close	X
to	X
him	X
say	X
that	X
Mr	X
Cameron	X
is	X
well	X
aware	X
of	X
the	X
need	X
for	X
politicians	X
to	X
"	X
keep	X
their	X
promises	X
"	X
.	X

Even	X
if	X
the	X
public	X
are	X
n't	X
always	X
convinced	X
that	X
they	X
do	X
.	X

Sir	X
Howard	X
has	X
provided	X
some	X
limited	X
wriggle	X
room	X
.	X

He	X
has	X
said	X
that	X
a	X
second	X
runway	X
at	X
Gatwick	X
is	X
a	X
"	X
credible	X
"	X
and	X
"	X
feasible	X
"	X
option	X
.	X

But	X
he	X
does	X
make	X
it	X
clear	X
that	X
it	X
would	X
provide	X
nowhere	X
near	X
the	X
economic	X
benefit	X
of	X
a	X
third	X
runway	X
at	X
Heathrow	X
.	X

The	X
political	X
battle	X
is	X
likely	X
to	X
be	X
long	X
and	X
bloody	X

certainly	X
has	X
some	X
big	X
political	X
beasts	X

are	X
sympathetic	X

back	X

Those	X
against	X
Heathrow	X
expansion	X
will	X
scour	X
Sir	X
Howard	X
's	X
report	X
to	X
argue	X
that	X
Gatwick	X
is	X
still	X
a	X
deliverable	X
option	X

Certainly	X
fewer	X
houses	X

there	X
will	X
be	X
fewer	X

if	X
a	X

built	X
south	X

Howard	X
is	X
clear	X

arguing	X
that	X
Heathrow	X
is	X
the	X
better	X
option	X
economically	X

Whether	X

it	X

Mr	X

also	X
said	X
that	X

a	X

to	X

lurid	X

Mr	X

's	X
proposals	X
for	X

very	X
familiar	X

this	X

does	X
not	X
make	X
them	X
wrong	X

the	X
portentous	X
pronouncements	X

a	X
long-lasting	X

It	X
is	X
perhaps	X
telling	X
that	X
Mr	X

objects	X
to	X
the	X
BBC	X
using	X
the	X
phrase	X
"	X

prefers	X

No	X

there	X
will	X
be	X
a	X
big	X
debate	X

loathe	X
that	X

it	X
seems	X
to	X
me	X

once	X

typical	X
of	X
Lowestoft	X

communities	X

The	X
school	X
's	X

there	X
were	X
some	X
tense	X
moments	X
between	X

her	X
predecessor	X

but	X
Nadia	X
says	X
there	X
is	X
a	X
will	X
to	X
change	X

"	X
Most	X
of	X

very	X

not	X

An	X
appeal	X
to	X
the	X
community	X
to	X
roll	X
up	X
its	X
sleeves	X
has	X
led	X
to	X
volunteers	X
offering	X
to	X
set	X
up	X

Which	X
raises	X
the	X
question	X
of	X
whether	X
it	X
's	X
Nadia	X
's	X
determination	X
to	X
lead	X
a	X
team	X
improving	X
the	X
school	X
that	X
will	X
make	X
as	X
much	X
difference	X
as	X
becoming	X
an	X
academy	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
easy	X
to	X
make	X
a	X
case	X
for	X
intervening	X
in	X
schools	X
that	X
are	X
underperforming	X
.	X

No	X
guarantee	X

But	X
Lowestoft	X
also	X
shows	X
that	X
simply	X
becoming	X
an	X
academy	X
,	X
free	X
from	X
the	X
management	X
of	X
the	X
local	X
council	X
,	X
is	X
not	X
a	X
guarantee	X
of	X
success	X
.	X

Many	X
of	X
the	X
pupils	X
from	X
Meadow	X
Primary	X
will	X
head	X
towards	X
what	X
is	X
now	X
called	X
East	X
Point	X
Academy	X
.	X

East	X
Point	X
Academy	X
has	X
only	X
recently	X
been	X
taken	X
out	X
of	X
special	X
measures	X

It	X
became	X
an	X
academy	X
in	X
2011	X
,	X
but	X
by	X
2013	X
under	X
the	X
management	X
of	X
the	X
troubled	X
AET	X
Academies	X
chain	X
it	X
was	X
in	X
special	X
measures	X
.	X

There	X
were	X
concerns	X
about	X
poor	X
teaching	X
,	X
truancy	X
and	X
bullying	X
.	X

In	X
2014	X
,	X
just	X
32	X

pupils	X
got	X
at	X

five	X

compared	X
with	X
the	X

Now	X
run	X
by	X
the	X
Inspiration	X
Trust	X
,	X
standards	X
are	X
rising	X
and	X
it	X
was	X
taken	X
out	X
of	X
special	X
measures	X
in	X
March	X
this	X
year	X
.	X

Kevin	X
Blakey	X
,	X
the	X
principal	X
,	X
recognises	X
he	X
is	X
up	X
against	X
a	X
degree	X
of	X
scepticism	X
from	X
parents	X
,	X
staff	X
and	X
pupils	X
because	X
of	X
the	X
school	X
's	X
recent	X
history	X
.	X

He	X
says	X
:	X
"	X
It	X
went	X
into	X
special	X
measures	X
as	X
an	X
academy	X
and	X
during	X
that	X
time	X
in	X
special	X
measures	X
it	X
had	X
four	X
principals	X

and	X
obviously	X
with	X
that	X
comes	X
some	X
instability	X

"	X

That	X
is	X
probably	X
an	X
understatement	X
.	X

So	X
what	X
exactly	X
does	X
he	X
get	X
out	X
of	X
being	X
part	X
of	X
an	X
academy	X
trust	X
?	X

As	X
a	X
new	X
head	X
,	X
Kevin	X
has	X
been	X
given	X
a	X
more	X
experienced	X
mentor	X

whom	X
he	X
meets	X
each	X
week	X
to	X
review	X
progress	X
and	X
talk	X
through	X
problems	X

And	X
he	X
tells	X
me	X
that	X
because	X
the	X
academy	X
chain	X
is	X
concentrated	X
in	X
nearby	X
Norfolk	X
,	X
he	X
is	X
also	X
calling	X
on	X

working	X

attending	X
the	X

Why	X
intervene	X
?	X

Which	X
brings	X
us	X
back	X
to	X
the	X
case	X
for	X
intervention	X
.	X

Education	X
Secretary	X
Nicky	X
Morgan	X
told	X
MPs	X
the	X
power	X
to	X
force	X
underperforming	X
schools	X
to	X
become	X
an	X
academy	X
is	X
about	X
creating	X
opportunities	X
.	X

"	X
We	X
believe	X
in	X
a	X
school-led	X
system	X
where	X
experts	X
have	X
greater	X
freedom	X
but	X
within	X
a	X
strong	X
framework	X
of	X
accountability	X
,"	X
she	X
said	X
.	X

Nicky	X
Morgan	X
says	X
academy	X
status	X
helps	X
create	X
opportunities	X

"	X
That	X
is	X
why	X
we	X
want	X
more	X
schools	X
to	X
benefit	X
from	X
the	X
freedom	X
that	X
academy	X
status	X
brings	X
.	X
"	X

But	X
just	X
last	X
week	X
,	X
Ofsted	X
warned	X
another	X
academy	X
chain	X
,	X
which	X
has	X
expanded	X
very	X
rapidly	X
,	X
that	X
many	X
of	X
its	X
schools	X
were	X
n't	X
improving	X
quickly	X
enough	X
.	X

In	X
particular	X
,	X
it	X
said	X
,	X
that	X
in	X
schools	X
run	X
by	X
Oasis	X
Community	X
Learning	X
Trust	X
:	X
"	X
Disadvantaged	X
pupils	X
,	X
particularly	X
boys	X
,	X
make	X
significantly	X
less	X
progress	X
than	X
their	X
peers	X
nationally	X
.	X
"	X

There	X
are	X
eight	X
Regional	X
Schools	X
Commissioners	X
who	X
are	X
meant	X
to	X
monitor	X
the	X
performance	X
of	X
academies	X
and	X
free	X
schools	X
.	X

They	X
have	X
very	X
few	X
staff	X
and	X
a	X
job	X
that	X
is	X
getting	X
bigger	X
.	X

It	X
will	X
also	X
fall	X
to	X
them	X
to	X
implement	X
the	X
new	X
powers	X
to	X
intervene	X
in	X
schools	X
identified	X
as	X
coasting	X
.	X

None	X
was	X
available	X
to	X
speak	X
to	X
the	X
BBC	X
before	X
the	X
draft	X
regulations	X
setting	X
out	X
the	X
detail	X
of	X
the	X
bill	X
about	X
how	X
this	X
will	X
work	X
.	X

The	X
risk	X
,	X
says	X
Tristram	X
Hunt	X
,	X
shadow	X
education	X
secretary	X
,	X
is	X
that	X
"	X
underperforming	X
schools	X
will	X
simply	X
pass	X
from	X
one	X
poor	X
provider	X
to	X
another	X
,	X
without	X
the	X
measures	X
required	X
to	X
turn	X
around	X
sub-standard	X
school	X
leadership	X
and	X
classroom	X
teaching	X
.	X
"	X

The	X
government	X
says	X
the	X
difference	X
is	X
it	X
can	X
intervene	X
more	X
rapidly	X
in	X
a	X
failing	X
academy	X
trust	X
.	X

Impact	X
on	X
pupils	X

The	X
question	X
is	X
whether	X
that	X
is	X
rapid	X
enough	X
to	X
make	X
a	X
difference	X
for	X
individual	X
pupils	X
.	X

People	X
like	X
18-year-old	X
David	X
Stephenson	X
,	X
whom	X
I	X
met	X
hanging	X

Academy	X
schools	X
:	X

Academies	X
are	X
independent	X
,	X
state-funded	X
schools	X
,	X
which	X
receive	X
their	X
funding	X
directly	X
from	X
central	X
government	X
,	X
rather	X
than	X
through	X
a	X
local	X
authority	X
.	X

Although	X
the	X
day-to-day	X
running	X
of	X
the	X
school	X
remains	X
with	X
the	X
head	X
teacher	X
or	X
principal	X
,	X
they	X
are	X
overseen	X
by	X
individual	X
charitable	X
bodies	X
called	X
academy	X
trusts	X
and	X
may	X
be	X
part	X
of	X
an	X
academy	X
chain	X
.	X

These	X
trusts	X
provide	X
advice	X
,	X
support	X
and	X
expertise	X
.	X

They	X
have	X
more	X
freedom	X
than	X
other	X
state	X
schools	X
over	X
their	X
finances	X
and	X
curriculum	X
,	X
and	X
do	X
not	X
need	X
to	X
follow	X
national	X
pay	X
and	X
conditions	X
for	X
teachers	X

As	X
of	X
June	X
2015	X
,	X
there	X
are	X
4,676	X
academies	X
open	X
in	X
England	X

There	X
are	X
hundreds	X
more	X
in	X
the	X
pipeline	X

The	X
number	X
has	X
grown	X
dramatically	X
under	X
the	X
coalition	X
government	X
,	X
from	X
203	X
in	X
May	X
2010	X

Now	X
over	X
half	X
of	X
all	X
secondary	X
schools	X
in	X
England	X
are	X
academies	X

be	X
a	X
welder	X
and	X
is	X
now	X
trying	X
to	X
gain	X
skills	X
at	X
college	X
.	X

But	X
his	X
school	X
years	X
were	X
at	X
Kirkley	X
Community	X
High	X
in	X
its	X
troubled	X
years	X
,	X
where	X
he	X
got	X
into	X
trouble	X
and	X
ended	X
up	X
in	X
a	X
student	X
support	X
unit	X
.	X

"	X
Basically	X
I	X
was	X
n't	X
taught	X
for	X
a	X
year	X
and	X
a	X
half	X
until	X
I	X
left	X
that	X
school	X

I	X
got	X
chucked	X
into	X
GCSEs	X
without	X
knowing	X
anything	X

I	X
was	X
lucky	X
to	X
scrape	X
out	X
Ds	X

"	X

David	X
is	X
clear	X
what	X
he	X
thinks	X
about	X
how	X
growing	X
up	X
in	X
Lowestoft	X
:	X
"	X
Pretty	X
let	X
down	X
,	X
because	X
it	X
's	X
not	X
the	X
fact	X
of	X
where	X
you	X
should	X
be	X
that	X
determines	X
how	X
good	X
a	X
school	X
should	X
be	X
.	X
"	X

This	X
in	X
essence	X
is	X
the	X
argument	X
for	X
intervening	X
in	X
areas	X
like	X
Lowestoft	X
.	X

Taking	X
a	X
similar	X
approach	X
in	X
areas	X
where	X
schools	X
have	X
broadly	X
been	X
told	X
they	X
are	X
good	X
will	X
be	X
more	X
controversial	X
.	X

Not	X
least	X
because	X
the	X
evidence	X
around	X
the	X
academy	X
model	X
is	X
mixed	X
.	X

As	X
Lowestoft	X
has	X
learnt	X
,	X
it	X
is	X
not	X
a	X
one-way	X
ticket	X
to	X
success	X

proposed	X
would	X

Puerto	X

would	X
have	X
to	X
amend	X
the	X

have	X
it	X
considered	X
a	X
state	X
for	X
the	X

Chapter	X

his	X

But	X
Rhodes	X
said	X
there	X
could	X
be	X
less	X
resistance	X

even	X

state	X
to	X

the	X
political	X

legal	X

constitutional	X
sensitivities	X
are	X
very	X
much	X
stronger	X
when	X
you	X
are	X
dealing	X

"	X

The	X
push	X
for	X
Chapter	X

took	X
on	X
more	X

But	X
Chapter	X

also	X
looks	X
like	X
a	X
long	X
shot	X

some	X
negotiations	X
go	X

on	X
Wednesday	X
struck	X
a	X

The	X

City	X
Council	X
two	X

13-2	X

draft	X
an	X

as	X

works	X
to	X
legalize	X

the	X
move	X

allow	X

In	X
2005	X

suspended	X

rules	X
in	X
the	X
Venice	X
Beach	X

where	X
the	X

has	X
allowed	X
street	X

only	X
to	X
sell	X
works	X

the	X

enforcement	X

a	X

none	X

was	X
surprising	X

To	X
me	X

Sittenfeld	X
seemed	X

'd	X
met	X
back	X
when	X
he	X
was	X
a	X
freshman	X

I	X
was	X

The	X
age	X
gap	X
was	X
too	X
big	X
for	X
us	X
to	X
become	X
close	X
friends	X

he	X
immediately	X
struck	X
me	X

gregarious	X

messy	X

perhaps	X

mostly	X
a	X
model	X
millennial	X

Then	X
Sittenfeld	X

spread	X
across	X

without	X

On	X

we	X
must	X
have	X
looked	X
very	X
similar	X

We	X
both	X
came	X
from	X
half-Jewish	X

We	X
both	X
majored	X

belonged	X
to	X

We	X
both	X
joined	X

We	X
were	X

After	X
graduation	X

I	X
interned	X
at	X
Newsweek	X

Sittenfeld	X
interned	X
at	X
Time	X

But	X
in	X
reality	X
,	X
I	X
could	X
never	X
keep	X
up	X
.	X

A	X
mutual	X
friend	X
recently	X
ran	X
into	X
Sittenfeld	X
at	X
a	X
wedding	X
.	X

"	X
At	X
one	X
point	X
we	X
were	X
dancing	X
it	X
was	X
late	X
,	X
but	X
P.G.	X
was	X
leading	X
the	X
charge	X
and	X
he	X
leaned	X
over	X
to	X
me	X
and	X
said	X
,	X
'	X
Do	X
you	X
want	X
to	X
know	X
what	X
my	X
philosophy	X
of	X
life	X

this	X
friend	X
recalled	X

"	X
So	X
I	X
said	X
sure	X

And	X
P.G.	X
shouted	X
,	X
'	X
Never	X
stop	X
moving	X

!	X

Later	X
that	X
night	X
,	X
he	X
told	X
me	X
that	X
he	X
'd	X
already	X
come	X
up	X
with	X
the	X
title	X
of	X
his	X
memoir	X
:	X
'	X
Appetite	X

'"	X

Sittenfeld	X
's	X
self-description	X
was	X
probably	X
self-mocking	X
in	X
fact	X
,	X
I	X
'm	X
sure	X
it	X
was	X
,	X
at	X
least	X
in	X
part	X
but	X
it	X
does	X
square	X
with	X
the	X
person	X
that	X
I	X
,	X
and	X
pretty	X
much	X
everyone	X
else	X
,	X
knew	X
at	X
school	X

The	X
first	X
time	X
I	X
encountered	X
the	X
name	X
P.G	X
.	X

Sittenfeld	X
a	X
moment	X
you	X
do	X
not	X
forget	X
was	X
when	X
I	X
read	X
in	X
the	X
campus	X
newspaper	X
that	X
he	X
'd	X
been	X
elected	X
freshman	X
class	X
president	X

The	X
date	X
was	X
Oct	X

7	X
,	X
2003	X

That	X
means	X
Sittenfeld	X
had	X
been	X
away	X
from	X
home	X
for	X
less	X
than	X
a	X
month	X
when	X
he	X
launched	X
his	X
campaign	X
.	X

It	X
takes	X
a	X
special	X
kind	X
of	X
17-year-old	X
to	X
jump	X
right	X
in	X
like	X
that.	X

"	X
The	X
real	X
reason	X
I	X
'm	X
doing	X
this	X
,"	X
Sittenfeld	X
told	X
the	X
paper	X
,	X
"	X
is	X
because	X
I	X
really	X
like	X

of	X
energy	X

"	X

Sittenfeld	X
could	X
have	X
been	X
grating	X
I	X
can	X
see	X
that	X
I	X
'm	X
making	X
him	X
sound	X
like	X
a	X
male	X
Tracy	X
Flick	X

he	X
was	X
n't	X

Everyone	X
liked	X
him	X

Yes	X
,	X
he	X
was	X
ambitious	X
;	X
he	X
seemed	X
as	X
if	X
he	X
'd	X
been	X
networking	X
from	X
birth	X
.	X

But	X
his	X
ambition	X
never	X
came	X
off	X
as	X
self-aggrandizing	X
;	X
he	X
was	X
n't	X
angling	X
for	X
power	X
,	X
or	X
other	X
people	X
's	X
esteem	X

It	X
was	X
simply	X
a	X
byproduct	X
of	X
his	X
personality	X
:	X
the	X
self-assurance	X

the	X
directness	X

the	X
off-the-charts	X
extroversion	X

The	X
result	X

was	X

it	X
had	X
some	X

to	X
it	X

for	X
the	X

told	X

his	X

what	X
exactly	X

by	X
that	X

a	X

'd	X
never	X
smoked	X
it	X
himself	X

insisted	X
that	X
it	X
was	X
"	X
totally	X
obscene	X

unacceptable	X

that	X
the	X
federal	X

makes	X
$	X
135	X
billion	X
in	X
profit	X
a	X
year	X
on	X
student	X

How	X
Sittenfeld	X
communicated	X
was	X
different	X
as	X
well	X

elements	X
were	X

the	X
contagious	X
optimism	X
the	X
sheer	X
delight	X
in	X

possibilities	X

only	X

feels	X

,	X
about	X
halfway	X
through	X

I	X
forgot	X

was	X
some	X

I	X
went	X
to	X

I	X
could	X
tell	X
that	X

had	X
changed	X
their	X
minds	X
about	X
him	X

too	X

was	X

supposed	X
to	X
dismiss	X

He	X
was	X
a	X
real	X
candidate	X

When	X
Sittenfeld	X
stood	X
up	X
to	X
leave	X

one	X
of	X
Kushma	X
's	X

pulled	X
him	X
aside	X

sniffed	X

As	X
Sittenfeld	X
worked	X
the	X
room	X
one	X
last	X
time	X
,	X
shaking	X
hands	X
,	X
it	X
occurred	X
to	X
me	X
that	X
millennials	X
may	X
never	X
flock	X
to	X
politics	X
the	X
way	X
that	X
,	X
say	X
,	X
baby	X

did	X
.	X

But	X
if	X
the	X
majority	X
of	X
those	X
who	X
do	X
whether	X
Democrat	X
or	X
Republican	X
are	X
as	X
clear-headed	X
as	X
Sittenfeld	X
,	X
we	X
're	X
going	X
to	X
be	X
fine	X
.	X

He	X
possesses	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
the	X
same	X
tics	X
and	X
traits	X
that	X
politicians	X
have	X
always	X
had	X
:	X
the	X
conviction	X
,	X
the	X
ambition	X
,	X
the	X
slickness	X
,	X
the	X
sociability	X
,	X
the	X
touch	X
of	X
arrogance	X
that	X
makes	X
you	X
believe	X
you	X
alone	X
are	X
the	X
right	X
man	X
or	X
woman	X
for	X
the	X
moment	X
(	X
and	X
makes	X
it	X
possible	X
for	X
you	X
to	X
persuade	X
others	X
of	X
that	X
,	X
too	X
)	X
.	X

But	X
he	X
has	X
something	X
else	X
as	X
well	X
.	X

Call	X
it	X
the	X
underdog	X
spirit	X
.	X

For	X
members	X
of	X
my	X
generation	X
,	X
politics	X
is	X
basically	X
an	X
aberrant	X
career	X
choice	X
.	X

It	X
is	X
n't	X
prestigious	X
anymore	X
;	X
it	X
's	X
inexplicable	X

So	X
as	X
a	X
millennial	X
,	X
you	X
either	X
enter	X
public	X
service	X
because	X
you	X
're	X
crazy	X

Aaron	X

spent	X
more	X
time	X
sculpting	X
his	X
abs	X

shaping	X
policy	X

was	X
eventually	X
forced	X
to	X
resign	X
after	X
shelling	X
out	X

40,000	X

redecorate	X

of	X
"	X
Downton	X

"	X
(	X
among	X

or	X
you	X
enter	X
public	X
service	X
because	X
you	X
're	X
really	X
,	X
really	X
driven	X
to	X
make	X
a	X
difference	X

You	X
wo	X
n't	X
impress	X
your	X

the	X

'll	X

going	X
against	X
the	X

And	X
,	X
like	X
Sittenfeld	X
,	X
you	X
'll	X
feel	X
an	X
even	X
greater	X
responsibility	X

good	X

prove	X

Here	X
's	X
the	X
bad	X
news	X
for	X
Chris	X
Christie	X
:	X
He	X
embarks	X
on	X
a	X
presidential	X
campaign	X
with	X
hardly	X
any	X
support	X

He	X
might	X
not	X
even	X
make	X
it	X
onstage	X
for	X
the	X
first	X
debate	X
,	X
because	X
unlike	X
four	X
years	X
ago	X
,	X
when	X

donors	X
were	X
begging	X
Christie	X
to	X
offer	X
himself	X
up	X
as	X
not	X

,	X
there	X
are	X
at	X

15	X

position	X

But	X
here	X
's	X
the	X
good	X
news	X
for	X
Christie	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
want	X
to	X
be	X
glass-half-full	X
about	X
it	X
:	X
At	X
least	X
he	X
's	X
not	X
running	X
for	X
reelection	X
as	X
governor	X
.	X

Because	X
with	X
a	X
30	X
percent	X
approval	X
rating	X
in	X
New	X
Jersey	X
,	X
Christie	X
is	X
now	X
less	X
popular	X
in	X
his	X
home	X
state	X
than	X
his	X
predecessor	X
,	X
Jon	X
Corzine	X
,	X
whom	X
he	X
beat	X
pretty	X
much	X
by	X
just	X
showing	X
up	X
and	X
having	X
a	X
pulse	X
.	X

If	X
Christie	X
takes	X
a	X
liking	X
to	X
bucolic	X
New	X
Hampshire	X
,	X
he	X
might	X
consider	X
moving	X
there	X

Of	X

,	X
much	X
has	X
been	X
made	X
already	X
this	X
week	X
of	X
Christie	X
's	X
plummeting	X
fortunes	X
in	X
New	X
Jersey	X

The	X
question	X
is	X
why	X
,	X
and	X
whether	X
it	X
really	X
matters	X
.	X

After	X
all	X
,	X
Christie	X
is	X
hardly	X
the	X
only	X
guy	X
in	X
the	X
race	X
who	X
could	X
use	X
a	X
change	X
of	X
scenery	X
.	X

There	X
are	X
four	X
sitting	X
Republican	X
governors	X
(	X
along	X
with	X
three	X
who	X
served	X
previously	X
)	X
now	X
running	X
or	X
on	X
the	X
verge	X
of	X
announcing	X
a	X

bid	X

And	X
of	X
the	X
four	X
current	X
governors	X
,	X
three	X
of	X
them	X
Christie	X
,	X
Wisconsin	X
's	X
Scott	X
Walker	X
and	X
Louisiana	X
's	X
Bobby	X
Jindal	X
would	X
almost	X
certainly	X
be	X
sent	X
packing	X
if	X
they	X
ran	X

The	X
fourth	X

Kasich	X

but	X
we	X
'll	X
get	X
to	X
that	X
in	X
a	X
moment	X
.	X
)	X

This	X
is	X
something	X
new	X
in	X
presidential	X
politics	X
;	X
it	X
's	X
as	X
if	X
your	X
boss	X
gave	X
you	X
a	X
terrible	X
job	X
review	X
,	X
and	X
you	X
responded	X
by	X
asking	X
the	X
company	X
's	X
shareholders	X
for	X
a	X
promotion	X
.	X

And	X
it	X
tells	X
us	X
something	X
not	X
just	X
about	X
these	X
governors	X
but	X
also	X
about	X
the	X
process	X
right	X
now	X
,	X
especially	X
inside	X
the	X
Republican	X
Party	X
.	X

Starting	X
,	X
perhaps	X
,	X
with	X
Watergate	X
,	X
governors	X
have	X
wielded	X
a	X
significant	X
advantage	X
in	X
presidential	X
primaries	X
and	X
general	X
elections	X
.	X

There	X
have	X
been	X
10	X
elections	X
between	X
1976	X
and	X
now	X
;	X
seven	X
of	X
them	X
were	X
won	X
by	X
current	X
or	X
former	X
governors	X
,	X
and	X
in	X
all	X
but	X
one	X
there	X
was	X
at	X
least	X
one	X
nominee	X
who	X
once	X
held	X
the	X
title	X
.	X

In	X
contrast	X
,	X
before	X
1976	X
,	X
you	X
would	X
have	X
had	X
to	X
go	X
back	X
20	X
years	X
to	X
find	X
a	X
governor	X
atop	X
either	X
ticket	X
,	X
and	X
all	X
the	X
way	X
back	X
to	X
1932	X
to	X
find	X
a	X
sitting	X
governor	X
who	X
actually	X
won	X
.	X

This	X
shift	X
was	X
n't	X
coincidental	X
.	X

After	X
Vietnam	X
and	X
Watergate	X
,	X
Washington	X
gradually	X
came	X
to	X
be	X
seen	X
as	X
a	X
symbol	X
of	X
deceit	X
and	X
dysfunction	X
,	X
ruled	X
by	X
politicians	X
who	X
cared	X
more	X
about	X
keeping	X
their	X
parties	X
in	X
power	X
than	X
about	X
reforming	X
the	X
system	X
.	X

Governors	X
,	X
on	X
the	X
other	X
hand	X
,	X
were	X
outsiders	X
and	X
problem	X
solvers	X
,	X
and	X
for	X
the	X
most	X
part	X
they	X
presented	X
themselves	X
as	X
pragmatists	X
.	X

(	X
Ronald	X
Reagan	X
is	X
the	X
notable	X
exception	X
here	X
,	X
as	X
he	X
is	X
in	X
many	X
things	X

new	X
,	X
digital	X
culture	X
and	X
its	X
corresponding	X
decline	X
in	X
institutional	X
loyalties	X
,	X
party	X
primaries	X
generally	X
have	X
become	X
more	X
about	X
the	X
shouting	X
than	X
the	X
doing	X
,	X
more	X
about	X
decrying	X
pragmatism	X
than	X
championing	X
it	X
.	X

You	X
ca	X
n't	X
even	X
hope	X
to	X
compete	X
if	X
you	X
ca	X
n't	X
get	X
one	X
of	X
a	X
handful	X
of	X
wealthy	X
,	X
extremist	X
ideologues	X
to	X
look	X
in	X
your	X
direction	X
.	X

And	X
this	X
creates	X
an	X
almost	X
irreconcilable	X
tension	X
for	X
anyone	X
who	X
actually	X
wants	X
to	X
govern	X
responsibly	X
and	X
run	X
for	X
president	X
at	X
the	X
same	X
time	X
.	X

Despite	X
his	X
reputation	X
for	X
blustering	X
,	X
Christie	X
actually	X
governed	X
in	X
his	X
first	X
term	X
as	X
a	X
guy	X
who	X
got	X
sensible	X
things	X
done	X
.	X

He	X
worked	X
with	X
a	X
minority	X
of	X
powerful	X
Democrats	X
to	X
reform	X
the	X
state	X
's	X
pension	X
system	X
and	X
hold	X
down	X
property	X
taxes	X
.	X

Hardly	X
any	X
Democrat	X
in	X
an	X
overwhelmingly	X
Democratic	X
state	X
wanted	X
to	X
run	X
against	X
him	X
in	X
2013	X
,	X
when	X
he	X
won	X
reelection	X
with	X
an	X
impressive	X
60	X
percent	X
of	X
the	X
vote	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
n't	X
just	X
the	X
Fort	X
Lee	X
bridge	X
idiocy	X
that	X
cost	X
Christie	X
much	X
of	X
that	X
cross-party	X
support	X
in	X
the	X
months	X
after	X
.	X

It	X
was	X
also	X
that	X
suddenly	X
Christie	X
was	X
eyeing	X
a	X
presidential	X
bid	X
,	X
and	X
this	X
meant	X
he	X
had	X
to	X
at	X
least	X
make	X
himself	X
palatable	X
to	X
the	X
kind	X
of	X
primary	X
voters	X
who	X
now	X
take	X
their	X
direction	X
from	X
radio	X
hosts	X
,	X
tea	X
party	X
activists	X
and	X
a	X
handful	X
of	X
elected	X
officials	X
who	X
exist	X
mostly	X
to	X
stir	X
up	X
paranoid	X
fantasies	X
of	X
tyranny	X
.	X

And	X
so	X
even	X
as	X
the	X
bridge	X
scandal	X
was	X
destroying	X
his	X
hard-won	X
alliances	X
in	X
New	X
Jersey	X
,	X
and	X
even	X
as	X
Christie	X
spent	X
more	X
time	X
out	X
of	X
the	X
state	X
,	X
he	X
refused	X
to	X
rebuff	X
the	X
people	X
who	X
saw	X
immunizations	X
as	X
a	X
government	X
conspiracy	X
.	X

He	X
renounced	X
Common	X
Core	X
and	X
stood	X
firm	X
against	X
gay	X
marriage	X
.	X

It	X
must	X
have	X
seemed	X
to	X
a	X
lot	X
of	X
voters	X
in	X
New	X
Jersey	X
that	X
Christie	X
was	X
only	X
a	X
"	X
truth	X
teller	X
"	X
when	X
he	X
was	X
n't	X
directing	X
his	X
rhetoric	X
at	X
voters	X
in	X
Iowa	X
and	X
New	X
Hampshire	X
.	X

Christie	X
ca	X
n't	X
win	X
New	X
Jersey	X
.	X

Does	X
that	X
matter	X
?	X

At	X
least	X
Christie	X
can	X
say	X
he	X
's	X
had	X
to	X
deal	X
with	X
a	X
mostly	X
Democratic	X
electorate	X
and	X
a	X
Democratic	X
legislature	X
,	X
which	X
would	X
probably	X
make	X
it	X
all	X
but	X
impossible	X
to	X
govern	X
harmoniously	X
while	X
running	X
for	X
president	X
,	X
in	X
any	X
event	X
.	X

Walker	X
does	X
n't	X
have	X
that	X
excuse	X
.	X

After	X
spending	X
most	X
of	X
his	X
governorship	X
attacking	X
every	X
union	X
and	X
cutting	X
every	X
tax	X
he	X
could	X
find	X
,	X
while	X
surviving	X
a	X
recall	X
election	X
and	X
endearing	X
himself	X
to	X
the	X
Koch	X
brothers	X
,	X
Walker	X
leads	X
a	X
Republican-controlled	X
state	X
that	X
's	X
basically	X
a	X
mess	X
.	X

The	X
middle	X
class	X
in	X
Wisconsin	X
is	X
apparently	X
shrinking	X
faster	X
than	X
in	X
any	X
other	X
state	X
,	X
and	X
the	X
projected	X
revenues	X
from	X
his	X
supply-side	X
program	X
have	X
yet	X
to	X
materialize	X
.	X

(	X
Shock	X
.	X
)	X

And	X
then	X
there	X
's	X
Jindal	X
,	X
who	X
has	X
transformed	X
himself	X
from	X
a	X
technocratic	X
boy	X
wonder	X
into	X
as	X
reliable	X
an	X
indicator	X
as	X
exists	X
of	X
wherever	X
the	X
social	X
conservatives	X
in	X
his	X
party	X
are	X
on	X
any	X
given	X
issue	X
.	X

His	X
most	X
recent	X
budget	X
had	X
to	X
cover	X
a	X
$	X
1.6	X
billion	X
crater	X

Judging	X
from	X
polls	X
,	X
Louisianans	X
would	X
sell	X
the	X
state	X
back	X
to	X
France	X
if	X
they	X
thought	X
they	X
could	X
unload	X
Jindal	X
in	X
the	X
deal	X
.	X

All	X
of	X
which	X
leads	X
me	X
back	X
to	X
Kasich	X
,	X
whose	X
experience	X
in	X
Ohio	X
has	X
been	X
different	X
and	X
perhaps	X
instructive	X
.	X

Unlike	X
the	X
other	X
three	X
current	X
governors	X
in	X
the	X
race	X
,	X
Kasich	X
suffered	X
a	X
cataclysmic	X
defeat	X
early	X
in	X
his	X
governorship	X
,	X
when	X
his	X
effort	X
to	X
roll	X
back	X
collective	X
bargaining	X
rights	X
for	X
public	X
employee	X
unions	X
went	X
down	X
to	X
resounding	X
defeat	X
at	X
the	X
ballot	X
box	X
.	X

His	X
popularity	X
plummeted	X
.	X

What	X
Kasich	X
did	X
then	X
,	X
however	X
,	X
was	X
to	X
focus	X
maniacally	X
on	X
job	X
creation	X
and	X
the	X
economy	X
,	X
while	X
putting	X
aside	X
just	X
about	X
everything	X
else	X
,	X
including	X
most	X
of	X
the	X
fights	X
that	X
thrill	X
conservative	X
activists	X
.	X

And	X
whether	X
he	X
deserves	X
the	X
credit	X
or	X
not	X
(	X
a	X
question	X
I	X
explored	X
here	X
in	X
some	X
depth	X
)	X
,	X
Kasich	X
has	X
presided	X
over	X
a	X
demonstrable	X
resurgence	X
;	X
Ohio	X
's	X
falling	X
unemployment	X
and	X
rising	X
incomes	X
have	X
consistently	X
outpaced	X
the	X
national	X
recovery	X
.	X

Reelected	X
with	X
64	X
percent	X
of	X
the	X
vote	X
last	X
year	X
,	X
Kasich	X
now	X
owns	X
an	X
approval	X
rating	X
above	X
60	X
percent	X
in	X
Ohio	X
which	X
,	X
if	X
you	X
have	X
n't	X
heard	X
,	X
is	X
kind	X
of	X
an	X
important	X
state	X
in	X
both	X
primaries	X
and	X
presidential	X
elections	X
.	X

Does	X
this	X
mean	X
that	X
Kasich	X
,	X
who	X
barely	X
registers	X
in	X
polls	X
at	X
the	X
moment	X
,	X
is	X
ultimately	X
a	X
more	X
viable	X
candidate	X
in	X
the	X
primaries	X
than	X
Christie	X
or	X
Walker	X
or	X
Jindal	X
?	X

Not	X
necessarily	X
.	X

Conservative	X
voters	X
are	X
so	X
distrustful	X
of	X
government	X
at	X
this	X
point	X
that	X
you	X
can	X
probably	X
convince	X
them	X
that	X
your	X
low	X
approval	X
ratings	X
are	X
evidence	X
of	X
your	X
making	X
hard	X
choices	X
,	X
like	X
cutting	X
everybody	X
's	X
taxes	X
.	X

Or	X
whatever	X
.	X

And	X
as	X
I	X
've	X
written	X
before	X
,	X
I	X
still	X
think	X
the	X
commentators	X
who	X
like	X
to	X
treat	X
campaigns	X
as	X
fantasy	X
baseball	X
too	X
readily	X
dismiss	X
Christie	X
's	X
skills	X
as	X
a	X
candidate	X
.	X

But	X
when	X
you	X
've	X
made	X
yourself	X
a	X
divisive	X
figure	X
at	X
home	X
in	X
hopes	X
of	X
uniting	X
Republicans	X
hundreds	X
or	X
thousands	X
of	X
miles	X
away	X
,	X
it	X
's	X
hard	X
to	X
be	X
taken	X
seriously	X
as	X
the	X
kind	X
of	X
governor	X
who	X
can	X
win	X
a	X
general	X
election	X
,	X
like	X
Clinton	X
or	X
Bush	X
.	X

Christie	X
likes	X
to	X
say	X
that	X
his	X
mother	X
taught	X
him	X
a	X
valuable	X
lesson	X
that	X
it	X
's	X
better	X
to	X
be	X
respected	X
than	X
loved	X
,	X
because	X
love	X
without	X
respect	X
never	X
lasts	X
anyway	X
.	X

Right	X
about	X
now	X
,	X
I	X
'm	X
guessing	X
he	X
'd	X
take	X
either	X
one	X
.	X

Sitting	X
eating	X
a	X
hot	X
dog	X
outside	X
Lyon	X
's	X
exhibition	X
centre	X

I	X
could	X
n't	X
help	X
noticing	X
the	X
group	X
at	X
the	X
next	X
table	X
.	X

Three	X
young	X
men	X
were	X
chatting	X
while	X
a	X
fourth	X
sat	X
completely	X
immobile	X
,	X
not	X
saying	X
a	X
word	X

Maybe	X
that	X
was	X
because	X
the	X
fourth	X
was	X
a	X
robot	X
.	X

Nobody	X
batted	X
an	X
eyelid	X
,	X
as	X
other	X
people	X
came	X
and	X
took	X
a	X
screwdriver	X
to	X
the	X
humanoid	X

then	X
this	X
was	X
Innorobo	X
,	X
Europe	X
's	X
largest	X
robotics	X
event	X

and	X
here	X
you	X
get	X
a	X
flavour	X
of	X
a	X
future	X
where	X
robots	X
live	X
amongst	X
us	X
.	X

To	X
anyone	X
who	X
's	X
roamed	X
the	X
vast	X
halls	X
of	X

the	X

runs	X

can	X
walk	X
from	X
one	X
end	X
of	X
Innorobo	X
to	X
the	X
other	X
in	X
five	X
minutes	X
-	X
but	X
in	X
that	X
time	X
you	X
will	X
see	X
more	X
innovation	X
packed	X
into	X
a	X
small	X
space	X
than	X
you	X
will	X
ever	X
find	X
in	X
those	X
gigantic	X
shows	X
.	X

The	X
show	X
's	X
focus	X
has	X
in	X
the	X
past	X
been	X
on	X
industrial	X
robotics	X
,	X
and	X
there	X
are	X
plenty	X
of	X
advances	X
on	X
this	X
front	X

I	X
spotted	X
a	X
robotic	X
arm	X
delicately	X
picking	X
up	X
individual	X

placing	X
them	X
in	X

recognise	X
us	X
-	X
and	X
that	X
's	X
just	X
one	X
of	X
the	X
controversial	X
issues	X
hanging	X
over	X
this	X
fast	X
growing	X
industry	X
.	X

As	X
well	X
as	X
privacy	X
,	X
there	X
are	X
concerns	X
about	X
safety	X
,	X
with	X
the	X
tragic	X
news	X
of	X
the	X
death	X
of	X
a	X
worker	X
crushed	X
by	X
a	X
robot	X
at	X
a	X
Volkswagen	X
factory	X
.	X

Until	X
recently	X
,	X
all	X
industrial	X
robots	X
were	X
locked	X
behind	X
cages	X
to	X
prevent	X
this	X
kind	X
of	X
accident	X
because	X
they	X
were	X
not	X
smart	X
enough	X
to	X
detect	X
a	X
human	X
in	X
their	X
path	X
.	X

Now	X
they	X
are	X
getting	X
more	X
sensitive	X
,	X
but	X
releasing	X
them	X
from	X
their	X
cages	X
may	X
bring	X
added	X
risks	X
.	X

And	X
then	X
there	X
's	X
the	X
question	X
of	X
jobs	X
.	X

One	X
firm	X
here	X
is	X
showing	X
off	X
an	X
autonomous	X
forklift	X
truck	X
,	X
effortlessly	X
shifting	X
pallets	X
without	X
the	X
aid	X
of	X
a	X
driver	X
.	X

The	X
driver	X
is	X
the	X
most	X
expensive	X
element	X
of	X
a	X
forklift	X
,	X
so	X
the	X
product	X
pays	X
for	X
itself	X
within	X
a	X
year	X
,	X
according	X
to	X
Fabien	X
Bardinet	X
of	X
Balyo	X
,	X
the	X
company	X
behind	X
the	X
autonomous	X
driving	X
technology	X
.	X

But	X
I	X
put	X
it	X
to	X
him	X
that	X
we	X
should	X
worry	X
about	X
the	X
threat	X
to	X
the	X
workforce	X
.	X

"	X
Forget	X
about	X
it	X
,	X
-	X
they	X
are	X
going	X
to	X
help	X
us	X
,	X
make	X
jobs	X
simpler	X
,"	X
is	X
his	X
response	X
.	X

Robots	X
are	X
expected	X
to	X
become	X
more	X
commonplace	X
in	X
factories	X
and	X
other	X
workplaces	X

His	X
thesis	X
is	X
that	X
by	X
making	X
companies	X
more	X
competitive	X
,	X
adopting	X
robots	X
will	X
create	X
jobs	X
rather	X
than	X
destroy	X
them	X
.	X

And	X
he	X
points	X
out	X
that	X
Germany	X
,	X
which	X
employs	X
far	X
more	X
industrial	X
robots	X
than	X
France	X
,	X
has	X
a	X
lower	X
level	X
of	X
unemployment	X
.	X

Let	X
's	X
not	X
exaggerate	X
the	X
threat	X
from	X
the	X
robots	X
-	X
they	X
are	X
still	X
very	X
bad	X
at	X
things	X
we	X
find	X
easy	X
,	X
like	X
climbing	X
stairs	X
or	X
telling	X
jokes	X
.	X

But	X
over	X
the	X
next	X
few	X
years	X
we	X
could	X
see	X
them	X
gradually	X
filling	X
more	X
human	X
roles	X
,	X
from	X
sales	X
assistants	X
to	X
child	X
minders	X
to	X
taxi	X
drivers	X
.	X

And	X
we	X
-	X
the	X
humans	X
-	X
will	X
have	X
to	X
decide	X
how	X
far	X
this	X
robot	X
revolution	X
should	X
go	X

result	X
of	X

membership	X

alongside	X
Dimitris'	X
astonishing	X
enterprise	X

In	X
the	X
early	X

90s	X

after	X
35	X
years	X
of	X
working	X
at	X
an	X
electrical	X
firm	X
in	X

Dimitris	X
returned	X
to	X
Anavra	X
,	X
intent	X
on	X
reforming	X
its	X
ailing	X
and	X
rustic	X
economy	X
.	X

After	X
successfully	X
running	X
for	X
mayor	X

his	X
first	X
move	X
was	X
to	X
travel	X
to	X
Brussels	X

he	X
met	X
with	X
every	X

official	X

would	X
talk	X
to	X
him	X
,	X
and	X
gathered	X
information	X
on	X
all	X
the	X
available	X
subsidies	X
for	X
rural	X
communities	X

Upon	X
his	X
return	X
to	X
Anavra	X
,	X
Dimitris	X
bypassed	X
the	X

admits	X

was	X
"	X
not	X
very	X
Greek	X
"	X

He	X
quickly	X
realised	X
that	X
many	X

development	X

were	X
environmentally	X
focused	X
,	X
and	X
in	X
order	X
to	X
qualify	X

encouraged	X
Anavra	X

farmers	X
to	X
go	X
organic	X

to	X
embrace	X
clean	X

support	X
two	X
initial	X
exploratory	X
wells	X

company	X
has	X
already	X
committed	X
about	X
$	X
7bn	X
(Â£	X
4.5bn	X

to	X
the	X
controversial	X
project	X

is	X
confident	X
it	X
will	X
find	X
huge	X
quantities	X
of	X
oil	X
in	X

region	X

But	X
if	X
the	X

will	X
contemplate	X

will	X
get	X
the	X
remaining	X
necessary	X
permits	X
in	X
the	X
next	X
week	X
or	X
two	X

The	X
initial	X
two	X
wells	X
will	X
be	X

shallow	X
water	X

about	X
40	X

off	X
the	X
coast	X
of	X
Alaska	X
,	X
and	X
they	X
will	X
use	X
conventional	X
drilling	X
techniques	X

The	X
company	X
should	X
know	X
whether	X
these	X
wells	X
find	X
sufficient	X
quantities	X
of	X
oil	X
to	X
justify	X
further	X
exploration	X

demand	X

more	X
than	X
20	X
%	X
of	X
the	X
world	X
's	X
undiscovered	X

and	X

can	X
be	X
found	X
in	X

Environmentalists	X
argue	X
vehemently	X
that	X
the	X

should	X
be	X
left	X
well	X
alone	X
,	X
as	X
the	X
risks	X
of	X
damaging	X
this	X
pristine	X
environment	X
are	X
too	X
great	X
.	X

Shell	X
believes	X
that	X
despite	X
the	X
environmental	X
risks	X
,	X
oil	X
can	X
be	X
extracted	X
safely	X
-	X
oil	X
that	X
it	X
argues	X
will	X
be	X
needed	X
to	X
meet	X
burgeoning	X
demand	X
for	X
energy	X
across	X
the	X
world	X
over	X
the	X
coming	X
decades	X
.	X

Given	X
the	X
recent	X
slump	X
in	X
the	X
price	X
of	X
oil	X
,	X
which	X
has	X
fallen	X
by	X
almost	X
half	X
in	X
the	X
last	X
year	X
to	X
$	X
65	X
a	X
barrel	X
,	X
many	X
believe	X
Arctic	X
oil	X
exploration	X
is	X
no	X
longer	X
economically	X
viable	X
.	X

Some	X
experts	X
say	X
the	X
break-even	X
point	X
for	X
Arctic	X
oil	X
is	X
closer	X
to	X
$	X
100	X
.	X

However	X
,	X
Shell	X
believes	X
that	X
longer	X
term	X
,	X
Arctic	X
oil	X
will	X
be	X
competitive	X

It	X
is	X
unlikely	X
that	X
the	X
company	X
will	X
be	X
producing	X
commercial	X
quantities	X
of	X
oil	X
before	X
2030	X

if	X
all	X
goes	X
to	X
plan	X

Some	X
investors	X
appear	X
to	X
agree	X

Despite	X
the	X
imminent	X
arrival	X
of	X
Apple	X
Music	X
,	X
Spotify	X
said	X
in	X
June	X
that	X
it	X

raised	X

more	X
than	X
household	X

loss	X
of	X
162m	X
(Â£	X

last	X

largely	X
because	X
its	X

70	X

Streaming	X
is	X
a	X
pretty	X
good	X
deal	X
for	X
music	X
fans	X
-	X

that	X

Many	X
artists	X
,	X
such	X
as	X

less	X
certain	X

because	X
